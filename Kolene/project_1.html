				<p id="Abstract">
				This is a recording of the 2013 ted talk of the American social psychologist Amy Cuddy. 
				In 2012 the psychologist published a research paper about the benefits
				of power poses. Reporting that participants of the research had a increase in confidence, 
				felt more powerful, and had physiological changes such as higher levels of testosterone and
				lower levels of cortisol after "posing" for a few minutes before the assessment. The research 
				was critised and refuted later on, and is now often used as a prime example of the cause of the replication crisis.
				This paper will touch on the importance of body language in human interactions bringing in other social science research
				on the subject. Additonally, it will tackle the controversies of the replication crisis, notably the critics on Amy Cuddy's
				paper.

			        <p id="reproduction crisis">
			          In 2015, I watched that ted talk, and trusted the source. Ever since, although I might not 
			          have applied Cuddy's concept on a regular basis, I thought that power posing could affect me,   
			          on a higher level than a placebo effect. This fall, in one of my pyschology classes, we spoke
			          about the "replication crisis". In the 2010's academic communities realized that many psychology studies
			          were hardly or not at all reproducible. When a study's reproduction is not conclusive, the 
			          problem could be comming for both sides and many other factors. However, if a study is not reproducible, it raises questions
			          about the validity of the original conclusion and results.

				<p id="theTalk">
				  Amy cuddy - EQ (emotional quotien), body awarness, body language (social scientist = non verbal communication)
				talks about the general interest in other peoples body languages, how we observe them and make big fusses about them
 			 	social scientist - body language effect on judgement that can lead to life changing outcomes (jobs, dates, doctor lawsuits)
				Digital - emoticons can lead to better negotiations outcome
				ourselves (thoughts, feelings, physiology) are influenced by body language
				her background - buisness, social scientist, prejudice, power dynamics, non verbal expressions of power and dominance
				animal kingdom - being big, making urself appear big / opening up
					humans too, as they are feeling powerful (pride)
					e.g. arm extension in the air for both blind people and seeing people
					reverse body language for reverse emotions
				gender differences, body language correlated with quantity and quality of participation in her classroom
					faking it till you are making it
					empirical evidence - nonverbal governs how people think and feel about us
					but can it change how we feel/act/behave?
					forced smile = happiness? // bodies changing mind (hormones)
				risk taking, optimism, assertivness - high testosterone, low cortisol
					primates - if one needs to become alpha --> increase in testosterone (for her this is evidence of body/role change shaping the mind)	
						I disagree - transferable to humans? other factors? animals that work highly in hierarchy, reproducive traits?
				experiment - conditions - low power versus high power for 2 min
					self test questionnaire, oportunity to gamble -> saliva sample
						high power = 86% say yes to gamble  low power = 60%
						testosterone: high = 20% increase   low = 10% decrease
						cortisol: high = 25% decrease low = 15% increase
				Can power posing change life in meaningful way?
					experiment 2 - job interview, blind coders/judges
						more hires for high power posers
						presence - passionate, enthusiastic, confident, authentic ect ect
				her personal story
					accident, smart, imposter syndrome
				</p>

				<p id="myOpinion">
				I think that the thought is good and optimistic. I also do believe that our body language 
				to some extent affects our physiology which can in turn affect our behaviour and feelings, resulting in
				our human interactions being different. Per example after running a marathon or doing bungee jumping, I believe
				that hte physiological arousal from that might make us less reserved and shy when talking to someone new. Or for example
				when we have just woken up we might still be full of inhibitory sleep hormones, making us slower and less social.
				So when listening to the talk I didn't question Cuddy's findings. After watching the ted talk I saw references of Amy Cuddy's
				study on power poses often, in books, in talks, and even in conversations with firends.
