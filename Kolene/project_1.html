				<p id="Abstract">
					This is a recording of the 2013 ted talk of the American social psychologist Amy Cuddy. 
				In 2012 the psychologist published a research paper about the benefits
				of power poses. Reporting that participants of the research had a increase in confidence, 
				felt more powerful, and had physiological changes such as higher levels of testosterone and
				lower levels of cortisol after "posing" for a few minutes before the assessment. The research 
				was critised and refuted later on, and is now often used as a prime example of the cause of the replication crisis.
				This paper will touch on the importance of body language in human interactions bringing in other social science research
				on the subject. Additonally, it will tackle the controversies of the replication crisis, notably the critics on Amy Cuddy's
				paper.

				<h2 id="tTitle">The Talk and Paper</h2>
				<p id="theTalk">
				   	Amy Cuddy is an American social psychologist, author, and public speaker. She has an academic and professional background in business, social sciences, prejudice, power dynamics and non-verbal expressions of power and dominance. In 2010, her, Dana carney and Andy Yap published “Power Posing: Brief Nonverbal Displays Affect Neuroendocrine Levels and Risk Tolerance” in the Association for Psychological Science journal. This paper summarized a study on body language, precisely on power posing, and its effect on people’s social image, self perception, and physiological states. The findings described in the paper were met with a loud success, and in 2012 Amy Cuddy presented a motivational summary of her research during a ted talk that is still up on the video platform YouTube. In this popular talk, Amy gives the audience some background on why this research is important to her. She shares that at one point in her life she identified and defined herself to the limited adjective of being smart, and so, following a car accident at 19years old that lowered her IQ she had an identity crisis and experienced imposter syndrome. She developed a motto and mindset to fake it until you believe it, and this motto resonate to the core body of her research, tricking your mind to be confident. Furthermore, she mentions social scientists’ and the general public’s interest and curiosity in human body language. 
				Her paper provides (evidence to find in the citations of her paper) evidence on the importance of non-verbal communication in humans, and in the animal kingdom. Bringing forth the how animals tend to make themselves appear big in situations where the want to assert dominance (evidence) and puts the behaviour in parallel to human. She brings up the innate nature of certain physical expressions such as prideful and celebratory arm extensions, which are observed both in seeing people and in blind people who couldn’t have learned this behaviour (evidence). She advances that since part of our judgement resides in body language, it can lead to life changing outcomes in job opportunities and at court hearing for example. Even bringing forth how this bleed into the digital world where emoticons can sometimes lead to better negotiations outcome. In her classroom, as a professor, she was able to observe that body language was correlated with the quantity and quality of participation in her classroom, making her wonder if by forcing a certain type of physical behaviour, one could change their action, feelings and even hormone activities.
				In her experiment Cuddy had two conditions, a high-power group, and a low power group. The high-power group would perform “high power” poses for 2minutes, so for example the wonder woman pose. The low power group would perform poses that made them smaller, hunched up for 2min. Their saliva was tested before and after the poses, and the high-power group saw a 20% increase in testosterone, and a 25% decrease in cortisol. On the other hand, the low power group saw a 10% decrease in testosterone and a 15% increase in cortisol. Additionally, the group were given a self test questionnaire about an opportunity to gamble, and 86% of the high-power group said yes, whereas only 60% of the low-power group said yes. In the second part of the experiment, the two groups were given fake job interviews with judges who weren’t informed of which participant belonged to which group. This resulted in more hires for the high power group, which were described as more passionate, confident and authentic.

				<h2 id="cTitle">The controversy</h2>
				<p id="TheControversy">
					In 2015 Eva Ranehill published a replication of Cuddy’s paper in the Psychological Science paper of the University of Zurich. Their conceptual replication had a bigger cast of participants, and more diversity in terms of gender. The results were only conclusive on the self reported feeling of power but did not show any significance in hormonal or behavioural change (Loncar., 2021). Carney, lead researcher on the power posing paper Amy Cuddy presented in the ted talk, emphasized a need for more direct future replication. In her team’s reply, they highlighted the differences between Ranehill’s replication and provided an extensive list of studies with statistical significance on “nonverbal expansive postures” (Loncar., 2021). However, out of the list of studies provided, it was found that only 36% could replicate. To add, in 2016 the lead research Dana Carney came out and admitted that “[she does] not believe that ‘power pose’ effects are real”. In 2017 the Comprehensive Results in Social Psychology journal, in an attempt to bring closure to the discussion, conducted a literature review in a special issue about power posing. Carney joined the initiative as reviewer and gave her feedback to the authors of the submission for the paper. The publication confirmed the results of Ranehill, finding no effect on hormonal or behavioral outcomes, and only finding significance in how posing affected participants’ feeling of power. The discussion was still ongoing and researchers and papers were looking at the manipulation, inclusion (or lack there off) of the p-value in the research. In 2019, Marcus Crede, a psychologist who focuses on individual differences, leadership and research methodology added to the discussion on the limitation of Cuddy and Carney’s paper, mentioning the lack of a control group. Indeed, there was a high power and a low power group, but no neutral poses. Possibly meaning that the effects observed in the original paper cannot solely be attributed to high power posing. All in all, the controversy continued well into 2020, and is a prime case study of the replication crisis.

				<h2 id="rTitle">The Replication Crisis</h2>
			        <p id="replicationCrisis">
					In 2015, I watched that ted talk, and trusted the source. Ever since, although I might no have applied Cuddy's concept on a regular basis, I thought that power posing could affect me, on a higher level than a placebo effect. This fall, in one of my psychology classes, we spoke about the "replication crisis". In the 2010's academic communities realized that many psychology studies were hardly or not at all reproducible. When a study's reproduction is not conclusive, the problem could be coming for both sides and many other factors. When asked about the reproducibility of a paper, many researchers agreed that factors such as selective reporting and pressure to publish had a big role in the replication crisis (Baker., 2016). Indeed, However, if a study is not reproducible, it raises questions about the validity of the original conclusion and results. Many journals seem to disfavor failed replication, resulting in less publications of unsuccessful replication and a lower rate of submission. Furthermore, researchers reported that lack of replication and oversight in the original laboratory, insufficient mentoring or poor experimental design in the replication are also responsible for the crisis. Few authors of the original studies being published reported being contacted for advice on the replication, showing a restraint from the replicators and the sensitivity of the subject of failed replications. 
				Additionally, when asked, researchers admitted that situations such as training in a laboratory where seniors have limited time can lead to an erosion of good laboratory practices such as mentoring. Lastly, researchers agreed that amongst other, a good understanding of statistics, good supervision and more within lab validation could be efficient ways to boost studies reproducibility.

				<h2 id="mTitle">My Opinion</h2>
				<p id="myOpinion">
					Amy Cuddy’s work and its role in the replication crisis has sparked nuanced dicussions on the need for rigorous research verification methods to be adopted. I think it was also a good reminder of the importance of conceptual and exact replications of studies. The conversations it started also made me realize that the focus on being published, the difficulties to justify publications of a failed replication and the discomfort researchers have to ask help from the original authors makes it hard to apply the verification measures. Regarding power poses, although the conversation is still opened about the limitations of the original paper, I think it is still valuable to explore the impact of body language on psychological states.
