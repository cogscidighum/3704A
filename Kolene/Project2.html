          	Similar to the one she gave on ted talks. And gave interviews about the power of body language concepts she developped during her research. Her interviews are significantly longer
	  	than the talks she gives, but they touch on similar topics. She does not have a strong internet presence, she does not have tweeter per example. And she has significantly
		dropped her number of talks since 2028. However, she kept giving interviews, and her most recent one was given only 3months ago. </p>

		Amy Cuddy’s TED Talk was not actually the first talk she gave after publishing her paper on body language and physiology, but it was the most popular. Her TED talk, after being published, quickly ranked as the second most-viewed TED talk, and still ranks as such. She also mentions in her “The Body Language Expert: 4 Body Language Tricks That Will Make People Love You & Respect You!” interview that, to this day, 10 years after her TED talk, she still receives emails from people who felt comforted, seen, and touched by her words. The majority of the videos she has are talks, and most of them summarize the findings of the original research paper. In the interview, she expounds on some other findings, and this essay will explore that conversation and try to bridge in other celscis and empirical findings, her experience and role in the reproduction crisis, and finally, the downfall of going viral and fame.

		In her interview, Cuddy reiterates the importance of body language and body posture, giving examples of the benefits of good posture and opened up yoga poses for people with depression and/or PTSD. In 2017, Wilkes et al. published research on the effect of posture on depressed individuals. They report the positive effects of good posture for self-esteem and mood in healthy individuals but highlight the missing literature on individuals with depression, even though bad and slouched postures are symptoms of depression. The baseline they started with all had a more slouched posture than in the normative data from the original study, and they found that adopting a better posture with the help of physiotherapy tape for 25 minutes improved their fatigue levels and their positive affects (Wilkes et al. 1). Cuddy continues to talk about the positive effect of other body behaviors such as breathing and speech tempo. They continue to discuss factors that might increase self-esteem, such as self-stories and commitment to yourself.
		
		They continue a part of the interview talking about self-confidence and touch on personal narrative, affirming that people with positive narratives have been correlated with living longer. They do acknowledge that a causal link has not been made, and this is the case for many personality and psychology traits that correlate with longevity. Other research has highlighted how self-narrative can reflect someone’s state of mind; for example, people who tell stories where they started off good but experienced a bad event tend to find less coherence in life and tend to be less driven, more anxious, and more depressed (McAdams, 1995). On the other hand, people who tell stories that started off as bad, but something good happened, tend to be more driven, feel a bigger sense of agency, and coherence in their life. In both cases, finding meaning and purpose in their stories was a good coping mechanism to acquire a sense of coherence in their life. I think there are two factors to consider here: how someone tells their story but also the cards they have been dealt in life. The interviewer mentions that being understanding with yourself in how you see and tell your story improves your self-esteem and your commitment to yourself.
		
		They then talk about how body behavior can affect how we are perceived and how we experience and navigate the world. They highlight the importance of being authentic, describing it as having your body language matching your speech and intentions, which is a hard thing to fake. And discuss the effectiveness of warm and confident language in human relations, in work and personal life. They discuss the universality of some behavior, such as facial expression, and the cultural specificities of others, such as eye contact, and how these two must be considered when trying to get more comfortable with demanding social tasks like public speaking, for example.

		They close off the interview by discussing her experience with workplace bullying. I had not yet been able to get Amy Cuddy’s side on the noise her paper and her talk created in academic discourses. In my research, I also did not see many purely negative views, but I could imagine, knowing the climate on the internet, that she might have experienced social shunning. Furthermore, I saw that she did not have a social media presence, and after listening to the interview, I am thinking it might be to protect herself. She mentions being bullied by other academics, online, and also in her former workplace, to the point of refusing to renew her contract and leaving her tenure. She talks about her experience with social death and having misinformation spread about her. With the interviewer, they discuss the mechanism of bullying and how people with lower social status but high achievement are often targeted and how bystanders are important in stopping harassment waves.
		
		I think that the key message of her numerous talks was to give people confidence and hope to grow their self-esteem and feel comfortable making space for themselves in the world. Although her research paper was at the center of the replication crisis and was criticized by many, there have been other replicable studies on the effects of body language on mood. This interview focuses on growing confidence, self-esteem, interpersonal relations. Through physical tactics like stretching in the morning, breathing, and talking more confidently, things to take more space in your environment, or mental motivation, positive self-narratives. I think that the way the TED talk was received is extremely unfortunate, and that if a study is not replicable, or the claims being made can be argued against, it should be an opportunity to re-evaluate research guidelines and open discussions, not engage in shaming and harassment.
