        	<h2 id="intro">The other content of Amy Cuddy</h2>
        	<p class="center"> A majority of the digital content in which Amy Cuddy appears online revisits the concepts she uncovered in her research. She gave a couple of talks 
          	Similar to the one she gave on ted talks. And gave interviews about the power of body language concepts she developped during her research. Her interviews are significantly longer
	  	than the talks she gives, but they touch on similar topics. She does not have a strong internet presence, she does not have tweeter per example. And she has significantly
		dropped her number of talks since 2028. However, she kept giving interviews, and her most recent one was given only 3months ago. </p>

        	<div id="chartContainer" style="height: 300px; width: 100%;"></div>

		<p class="center">
		Her interviews are very popular, and are notably present in buisness spheres in conversations about being respected, and feeling confident. Her first two talks are her most popular videos 
		on youtube, and following it is an interview where she discusses ... (WATCH INTERVIEW).
