        <p> A majority of the digital content in which Amy Cuddy appears online revisits the concepts she uncovered in her research. She gave a couple of talks 
          Similar to the one she gave on ted talks. And gave interviews about the power of body language concepts she developped during her research. Her interviews are significantly longer
	  than the talks she gives, but they touch on similar topics. </p>
