<h1>Welcome to Darcy's Project 2!</h1>
    <h2>CogSciDigHum CelSci Project</h2>
    <p> 
      Donald Hoffman has a significant online presence where he discusses his theory of consciousness and the reality interface. There were numerous videos to choose from on YouTube, and I have selected five to discuss in my project 2. In our digital data analysis and sharing in cognitive science class, this extensive database of online videos shows that Hoffman's theory has a substantial influence in cloudtopo, providing people with access to his ideas. He has been interviewed by many individuals, leading to interesting and thought-provoking discussions about AI, the nature of reality, consciousness, and what happens after death. Hoffman explores areas of research that most cognitive scientists do not, reminiscent of the exploration-exploitation tasks discussed in class. Hoffman is searching for novel information, utilizing newly developed tools and mathematical equations to find answers to questions about consciousness. This paper expands on topics discussed in my project 1.

    <p>
      This video by Closer to Truth was published in 2020 and has 173,747 views on YouTube. The focus of this video is on consciousness and how the concept differs in Donald Hoffman’s theory. He posits that consciousness did not arise as a product of space and time but is something beyond that. The interview delves into theories of consciousness, highlighting the challenge faced by physicalists who approach consciousness but consistently reach a deadlock. Although researchers have identified strong neural correlates to consciousness, they have not been able to establish a causal theory, known as the hard problem of consciousness. Hoffman advocates for a departure from the physicalist approach, believing that alternative approaches are necessary to solve this problem. This motivates him to explore a different knowledge space than other researchers, aiming to create a mathematically precise model of his theory to explain consciousness.

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SL-j1XoDms" target="_blank">Truth vs. Reality: How we evolved to survive, not to see what’s really there | Donald Hoffman</a>
    <p>
      Published by Big Think in 2019, this video has 755,095 views on YouTube. It provides a historical perspective on how Donald Hoffman developed his theory of reality as an interface, emphasizing how evolution concealed the truth from us for survival. The video begins with Galileo challenging accepted concepts, asserting that the Earth is not the center of the world and that it orbits the sun. He also believed that only objective reality continues to exist when there is no living thing to perceive it. Hoffman extends this idea, claiming that even objectively real things in our world are not real, or are merely icons of what's truly there. These representations of icons is all that we need to see in order to survive and evolution favoured this adaptation. He questions whether natural selection favours organisms with sensory systems that perceive the objective truth of reality. Hoffman and his colleagues ran evolutionary game simulations, concluding that organisms perceiving the truth did not outcompete those focusing solely on fitness payoffs, suggesting that seeing the truth could lead to extinction. Therefore, humans only see the fitness payoffs, what we need to see, in order to survive. Hoffman uses the analogy of life as a video game, where our focus on fitness payoffs as the points in the video game and this prevents us from seeing the actual structure of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      This concept of our interfaces concealing what's truly in our environment exemplifies cognitive modelling. The neural networks involved in developing our interfaces would require even more hidden layers that we cannot see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truth and fitness are not the same, our perceptions change based on our fitness level. For example, the value of steak differs for a hungry lion compared to a well-fed lion or a bunny. While we share similar interfaces, our interpretations may differ based on our needs. Hoffman's theory analyzes whether an object, such as a red apple, exists in the same way when our eyes are closed as it does when our eyes are open. It's interesting to note how Donald Hoffman adapts and improves his theory through the scientific process of listening and responding to criticisms in this abstract cognitive field of research.

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbWGJeKq4tU&t=24s" target="_blank">Does Consciousness Survive Death? | Prof. Donald Hoffman | The Tim Ferriss Show</a>
    <p>
      Published by Tim Ferriss in 2022, this video has 127,542 views on YouTube. It delves into applying Donald Hoffman’s views to consciousness after death. From a purely physicalist viewpoint, consciousness ends with death. However, under Hoffman's theory, where consciousness is fundamental and spacetime is not, consciousness may survive death. This complex idea suggests that consciousness can move beyond the interface we interact with, although proving it is immensely challenging. Hoffman likens consciousness to wearing a virtual reality headset; removing it makes the icons disappear, but it doesn't mean you cease to exist, you enter a different interface beyond the conceptual idea of space and time. The possibilities for exploring and understanding consciousness are endless.

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd6CQCbk2ro" target="_blank">The Case Against Reality | Prof. Donald Hoffman on Conscious Agent Theory</a>
    <p>
      Published by ZDoggMD in 2019, this video has 846,064 views on YouTube. The video begins with an overall summary of Donald Hoffman's views before delving into specific concepts such as medicine, spirituality, artificial intelligence, split-brain patients, and synesthesia. Similar concepts to those in previous video summaries are discussed, including simulations of natural selection and the challenge of explaining conscious experience. The theory postulates that we create the idea of spacetime, and there are other consciousnesses that exist. An interesting point is the use of the matrix analogy to describe Hoffman's theory, reminiscent of my approach in project 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      Donald Hoffman has a heavy emphasis on the mathematical capabilities to solve the problems of consciousness. I am not sure what exactly he means by that but perhaps it has to do with calculations from the game evolution simulation experiments he has conducted. He argues against solving the consciousness problem with unconscious elements, asserting that conscious agents form our reality, creating a social network connecting elements without revealing the full process. He uses the example that it is like the twitterverse. As discussed in our social media lecture, social networks like Twitter/X and Facebook create a social niche connecting large masses of people with information together. However, the search for information can also bring along the spread of misinformation emphasizing the need to critically analyze Hoffman’s research (and any research), to reduce the risk of misinformation. 
    </p>
    <p>
      One detailed question they explore is why we all see similar things in our environment. Hoffman's theory posits that we don't create a reality, but the representations within our reality are created to mask what's truly there. A central point Hoffman emphasizes is our longstanding belief in the existence and reality of objects because we can interpret them with our senses. This makes it challenging for us to let go of concepts like spacetime, which are familiar but, according to Hoffman, may not represent the truth. This research is seeking new developments using theories with mathematics, experimentation, and data manipulation, aligning with the research methods of past researchers and scientists mentioned in class, such as Turing, Fechner, and Newton.
    </p>
    <p>
      An application of this research is its potential to advance the field of medicine in areas where it has struggled, such as understanding consciousness, explaining mental disorders, and placebo effects. The interviewer, being a doctor, provides insight into how diagnostic medicine sometimes overlooks the conscious reality of patients by solely considering the brain as a computer. Hoffman suggests that accessing the code of our interfaces could allow us to change our interface and, consequently, the parameters of space and time. This relates to generative AI, as discussed in class, which requires massive parameters and neural networks. Perhaps the theory could be represented in a generative AI model, proving that spacetime is not fundamental. The concept of being able to see the code of our interfaces, reminds me of open access data tools and websites discussed in class. Even if the idea of understanding how the interface works seems improbable to me, using open access tools can make the research more accessible to all, potentially through the use of large language models within artificial intelligence, as learned in class.
    </p>
    <p>
      The video also contemplates that death doesn't mean the cessation of consciousness. It would be like stepping out of the interface as if you were playing in a virtual reality space. The representation no longer exists in the virtual game, but you are no longer in that interface. Another interesting topic discussed is the implications arising from cases of synesthesia. This is seen as evidence of changes in the interface. Individuals with synesthesia perceive reality differently, and their interface reacts uniquely, allowing them to see colours or sounds associated with words and numbers and taste with touch. This could suggest a different heritable interface. Another aspect of the conversation explores the concept of one infinite conscious agent, God. Hoffman’s theory merges scientific and spiritual ideas, providing a link between spiritual beliefs and scientific explanations. Given the abstract and challenging nature of this research to establish any causal relationships, both discuss the importance of caring about this type of research. Firstly, over the past few decades, we have witnessed massive technological changes, particularly in artificial intelligence recently, as discussed in our general AI tools and issues class. Hoffman's theory has created a niche that uses the tool of machine learning to understand the mind, making it an intelligent niche construction. Secondly, it is considered a possible way to move forward or inspire other ideas to solve scientific problems. Lastly, Hoffman emphasizes that questioning these aspects and understanding our place in the world is fundamentally human. An intriguing topic explored is whether AI machines might possess consciousness, connecting to class discussions about potential ethical concerns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hoffman suggests that there might be conscious agents we currently don't have access to, implying that consciousness could be never-ending. This part of the discussion is inspiring, highlighting the meaning of life as a journey to explore, learn, grow, and love one another. It enhances my understanding of the concepts and implications of this theory, revealing more hot cognition involved in Donald Hoffman’s theories than I previously thought.

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUIinjJLjkQ&t=1062s" target="_blank">What is consciousness? | Donald Hoffman and Lex Fridman</a>
    <p>
      The final video by Lex Fridman on Lex Clips, published in 2022, has 256,368 views on YouTube. It is an intriguing discussion, delving deeper into Hoffman’s views on consciousness. The conversation starts with the concept that we all assume spacetime is fundamental. Still, Hoffman suggests discarding this old framework to move beyond the problems we are stuck on, assuming that spacetime is not fundamental. Donald Hoffman, a cognitive scientist, believes spacetime is doomed, which, upon further questioning, doesn't mean it is wrong, it just means it's not necessary, a confusing aspect of his argument. He equates it to a widely believed assumption that could be wrong, similar to the once-believed fact that the Earth was the center of the universe. Hoffman believes that the reductionism of neural correlates to consciousness is wrong and was only needed as a heuristic tool for survival. However, it has now become an artifact that we should move beyond. Hoffman is seeking an answer to explain and reconcile the relationship between conscious experiences, such as having a headache or seeing the colour red, and the subjective experience of what it feels like to have that experience, which is precisely the hard problem of consciousness. He is attempting to solve this problem using mathematics to create a solid theory. Hoffman also suggests that there are various consciousnesses, human consciousness is just one. There could be an infinite number of consciousnesses, relating to our class's idea of the cogsphere, meaning that there are infinite levels of consciousness and interaction within the cogsphere, with the cogsphere being just one aspect of our interface reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Split-brain patients can have different conscious experiences, demonstrating the complexity of consciousness as a conceptualization. The source of consciousness experience has yet to be solved, and it remains unclear whether there will be ways to see it or if it will remain unsolved. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Evolution plays a significant role in how we perceive the world today. Donald Hoffman's idea is that perception acts as a user interface, and that interface can change or be removed to reveal different interfaces, allowing us to interact with different consciousnesses. Reality, according to his theory, is made up of conscious agents forming a network, with mathematics used to explain and provide evidence for this idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am still skeptical of his theories and find it difficult to believe in light of the evidence he has provided. Additionally, he explains his views in overcomplicated language, which I believe should be articulated in more layman’s terms. I am often unsatisfied with some of his responses to the interviewers' questions, as they do not fully address the questions asked, especially regarding what distinguishes what is considered not fundamental versus what he defines as 'wrong' in his arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Donald Hoffman’s theories are controversial and, at times, convoluted to understand, but the discussions in the five videos have been thought-provoking. Each raises difficult questions about consciousness and challenges our ingrained beliefs about humanity and reality.
