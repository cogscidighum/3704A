      <p>Howard Gardner is an American cognitive scientist, specializing in developmental psychology and the John H. and Elisabeth A. Hobbs Research Professor of Cognition and Education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education at Harvard University (Gardner, 2022). Howard is one of the founding members behind Harvard Project Zero (HPZ), who initially focused on researching and deeply understanding the nature of artistic knowledge. Now, HPZ spans a wider spectrum of education and epistemological issues, with a mission to understand and nurture human potentials – such as learning thinking, ethics, intelligence and creativity (Harvard, 2022). He has been recognized on a global scale and is a well decorated scientist, with honorary degrees from over 30 colleges and universities, and various awards recognizing his research. More specifically, Howard proposed his theory of multiple intelligences, which breaks down the modern idea of overall intelligence into distinct types of intelligences that can each be scaled to their own unique strengths.  </p>

<!--talk about iq and intro to theory-->
	<p>In the modern age, intelligence is commonly measured by a standard test of intelligence quotient (IQ), which expresses the relative intelligence of a person. IQ was originally calculated by taking the ratio of a person’s mental age with their chronological age. Then further developed in Paris, France, through Alfred Binet and his colleagues who were tasked by city leaders to determine who would be the most successful children in elementary school (Binet & Simon, 1916; Block & Dworkin, 1976). This evolved into the first set of intelligence tests and the construct of IQ. Which eventually became the modern-day testing system that propels today’s education. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for intelligence tests to be conducted for non-educational purposes. For instance, tests are produced for every social purpose such as for teachers, supervisors, soldiers and police officers (Gould, 1981).	</p>

	<p>The issue currently as hand and that has been expressed is that the standard test of intelligence quotient is not the ideal way to test intelligence. In addition, the standardized intelligence tests heavily valorize language, mathematics and logic, which are idolized in the test taking for future endeavors like college entry. However, looking at the world as a whole and all the career opportunities available, language, mathematics and logic can only get someone so far. This is where Howard Gardner realized that perhaps intelligence should not be looked at and tested as a single measurement, but as multiple intelligences; hence his theory of multiple intelligences. Gardner believes that there are indeed 8 different intelligences that make up a person, which are: linguistic intelligence, logical-mathematical intelligence, musical intelligence, bodily-kinesthetic intelligence, spatial intelligence, interpersonal intelligence, intrapersonal intelligence and naturalist intelligence. In the more recent years Gardner has been studying more intelligences that he thinks will eventually be added to the official roster, which are: teaching or pedagogical intelligence and an existential intelligence.	</p>

      <h4>Linguistic Intelligence</h4>
	    <p>Starting with the first of the popular intelligences favoured by IQ tests, linguistic intelligence is the ability to analyze information and create products involving oral and written languages (Davis & Christodoulou & Seider & Gardner, 2011). This even extends oral and written languages; to signed languages. For instance, in deaf communities where signed language is not explicitly taught, signed speakers with often invent their own manual language (Gardner, 1993). Linguistic intelligence is simply a measure of linguistic skill. For example, measuring how well children speak, are able to decipher and infer information or how what stories they are able to create. Such abilities are seen through poets, writers and journalists, to name a few. This ability may even be lost through damage to the Broca’s area of the brain, which is responsible for speech articulation and production. Without it, someone may be able to understand speech, but completely unable to string words together to make even the simplest of sentences. </p>
	    
      <h4>Logical-Mathimatical Intelligence</h4>
	    <p>The other half of valorized IQ tests comes from the logical-mathematical intelligence, which allows the ability to develop equations and proofs, making calculations and solve abstract problems (Davis & Christodoulou & Seider & Gardner, 2011). Logical-mathematical intelligence has been seen as the idol of intelligence for its “raw intelligence” factor, in other words, being able to problem solve. Moreover, constructing solutions to problems before is it articulated, even if the process is invisible to the solver, responsible for the common “aha!” phenomenon when a problem is solved. This is predominantly common among logicians and more specifically those in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) careers. For example, they are constantly able to perform mathematical proofs, perform experimentations and conduct scientific reasoning. </p>
	    
      <h4>Musical Inteligence</h4>
	    <p>Next, musical intelligence is the ability to produce, remember, and make meaning of different patterns of sounds and rhythms (Davis & Christodoulou & Seider & Gardner, 2011). This has been proven through the support of child prodigies, who have rapid progress in the 
short time of learning music, even though they have never received training for their instrument before. It is as though they were biologically prepared for music, supporting the claim that there is a biological link to such a particular intelligence; music. Furthermore, there are even special cases, in which children on the autism spectrum will be able to learn music and play instruments beautifully, despite not being able to communicate.
</p>
	    
      <h4>Bodily-Kinesthetic Intelligence</h4>
	    <p>Moving on, bodily-kinesthetic intelligence is split into two fashions. On one end it can mean to be able to use one’s body to solve problems or to produce items (Davis & Christodoulou & Seider & Gardner, 2011). For instance, athletes are able to project themselves towards an end goal, dancers are able to convey a message through movement, or something as simple as trades work, using the body for physical labour. On the other end, bodily-kinesthetic intelligence can translate to using the hands or other body parts to be able to solve problems or to produce items (Big Think & Gardner, 2016). A great example of this would be a crafts person, even if they may not be a good athlete, they would be able to make creations using just their minds and hands. </p>
      
      <h4>Spatial Intelligence</h4>
	    <p>Similarly, to bodily-kinesthetic intelligence, spatial intelligence too is split into two fashions. It is the ability to recognize and manipulate large-scale and fine-grained, small-scale, images or areas (Davis & Christodoulou & Seider & Gardner, 2011). A variation of spatial intelligence at a large-scale would be something that sea captains or airplane pilots possess for broader navigation. Being able to navigate around a large territory like getting from point A to point B is a practice of spatial intelligence. On the contrary, a small-scale variation of spatial intelligence would resemble someone like a chess player or a surgeon, who has to navigate meticulously in tight spaces. </p>
	
      <h4>Interpersonal Intelligence</h4>
	    <p>The following two intelligences pertain more to human interactions. Starting with interpersonal intelligence, it is the ability to recognize and understand other people’s moods, desires, motivations, and intentions (Davis & Christodoulou & Seider & Gardner, 2011).  
This includes being empathetic, working together in cooperation, or plain interactions with surrounding peers. Workplaces in general require interpersonal intelligence to function. More importantly, leaders require interpersonal intelligence to be able to manage their people with care. Interpersonal intelligence may also be deceiving and be used negatively. For instance, a business man with high interpersonal intelligence may be great at selling unwanted products at an unwanted price, but nonetheless, they are succeeding in their role. 
</p>

      <h4>Intrapersonal Intelligence</h4>
	    Intrapersonal intelligence is being able to recognize and understand one’s own self- their own moods, desires, motivations and intentions (Davis & Christodoulou & Seider & Gardner, 2011). Understanding one’s self before was not as big of a deal as it is in the modern day. Before, people used to just follow their ancestral, lineage when it came to careers, because there were not many careers to begin with. In the present day, with a developed society, people lead their own lives (Big Think & Gardner, 2016). It is common for those to choose their own career path or even switch careers for example. There are many factors to contemplate when it comes to living a life. Without intrapersonal intelligence, it would be difficult to navigate through it all. 
	    
      <h4>Naturalist Intelligence</h4>
	      <p>Lastly, the final intelligence is a naturalist intelligence. This is the ability to identify and distinguish among different types of plants, animals, and weather formations that are found in the natural world (Davis & Christodoulou & Seider & Gardner, 2011). Gardner also calls this the intelligence of Charles Darwin (Big Think & Gardner, 2016). Although believed to not be useful in the modern day, Gardner argues that the commercial world is full of the use of naturalist intelligence, as the brain is very adaptive. Natural intelligence is used for personal decisions such as buying one jacket over another or choosing one hairstyle over another. Giving insight to what is naturally desired. </p>

      <h4>Bonus</h4>
	      <p>There are two more intelligences that Gardner has expressed interest in, which is the teaching or pedagogical intelligence and an existential intelligence. In brief, teaching or pedagogical intelligence measures how well one’s teaching capabilities are; how well someone is able to dissect a lesson in a digestible and effective manner for a student to understand. While, existential intelligence, tackles the ability of asking and answering big philosophical questions, such as, “what does it mean to love?” or “what is the meaning of life?”</p>
