        <p>To revise, Howard Gardner is a famous cognitive scientist specializing in developmental Psychology. Currently he is the John H. and Elisabeth A. Hobbs Research Professor of Cognition and Education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education at Harvard University (Gardner, 2022). Howard was a founding professor of Harvard Project Zero (HPZ) and currently is on a mission to understand the nurture of artistic potentials. He is a globally recognized and decorated scientist but is most famously known for his theory of multiple intelligences, which tackles the traditional idea of a single intelligence, by providing a pluralistic approach with strengths and weaknesses. </p>

      Standard tests of intelligence quotients (IQ) were the former fashion of measuring intelligence among students. The former idea of intelligence was a single basis that heavily emphasized on short-term memorization and linguistics, which became the majority of how test-taking is presented today. Furthermore, these short-term memorization tests even extend into the professional world for teachers, supervisors, executives and more (Gould, 1981). Howardâ€™s approach to intelligence aims to break down intelligence into 8 different platforms, offering a pluralistic approach to intelligence.  Modern intelligence is valorized through the linguistic and logical-mathematical intelligence. Linguistic intelligence is measured through the analysis and creation of oral and written languages, while logical-mathematical intelligence demonstrates the ability to develop equations and proofs and solving abstract problems. Next, musical intelligence shows the ability to produce, remember and make meaning of patterns of sounds and rhythms. Bodily-kinesthetic intelligence is split into two paths, one through the use of the body to solve problems such as in athletics and the other to use to body to produce items such as working in the trades. Spatial intelligence demonstrates navigating and manipulating large-scaled and/or small-scale areas. Moving on, interpersonal intelligence looks at recognizing and understanding the emotions and intentions of other people. While intrapersonal intelligence looks at recognizing and understanding the emotions and intentions of oneself. Lastly, the naturalistic intelligence highlights identifying and distinguishing the environment in the natural world.
