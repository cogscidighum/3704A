          To revise, Howard Gardner is a famous cognitive scientist specializing in developmental Psychology. Currently he is the John H. and Elisabeth A. Hobbs Research Professor of Cognition and Education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education at Harvard University (Gardner, 2022). Howard was a founding professor of Harvard Project Zero (HPZ) and currently is on a mission to understand the nurture of artistic potentials. He is a globally recognized and decorated scientist but is most famously known for his theory of multiple intelligences, which tackles the traditional idea of a single intelligence, by providing a pluralistic approach with strengths and weaknesses. </p>

        <p style="font-size:110%;">
          Standard tests of intelligence quotients (IQ) were the former fashion of measuring intelligence among students. The former idea of intelligence was a single basis that heavily emphasized on short-term memorization and linguistics, which became the majority of how test-taking is presented today. Furthermore, these short-term memorization tests even extend into the professional world for teachers, supervisors, executives and more (Gould, 1981). 
    	    </p>
      
        <p style="font-size:110%;"> 
          Howard’s approach to intelligence aims to break down intelligence into 8 different platforms, offering a pluralistic approach to intelligence.  Modern intelligence is valorized through the linguistic and logical-mathematical intelligence. Linguistic intelligence is measured through the analysis and creation of oral and written languages, while logical-mathematical intelligence demonstrates the ability to develop equations and proofs and solving abstract problems. Next, musical intelligence shows the ability to produce, remember and make meaning of patterns of sounds and rhythms. Bodily-kinesthetic intelligence is split into two paths, one through the use of the body to solve problems such as in athletics and the other to use to body to produce items such as working in the trades. Spatial intelligence demonstrates navigating and manipulating large-scaled and/or small-scale areas. Moving on, interpersonal intelligence looks at recognizing and understanding the emotions and intentions of other people. While intrapersonal intelligence looks at recognizing and understanding the emotions and intentions of oneself. Lastly, the naturalistic intelligence highlights identifying and distinguishing the environment in the natural world (Davis & Christodoulou & Seider & Gardner, 2011).

  	  <h3>How the Theory of Multiple Intelligences Came to Be</h3>
        <p style="font-size:110%;">
          As the previous project mainly discussed the intelligences and expanding on them and the former singular idea of intelligence, this discussion aims to shed light on the intention and formation behind Howard Gardner’s theory of intelligence. In the chosen videos, Howard Gardner expands on the behind the scenes thinking of his popular theory of intelligence. 
          </p>
      
        <p style="font-size:110%;">
	        To set the scene, Howard Gardner began his career working with children and patients who have undergone some sorts of brain damage. Through his sessions between the diverse group of encounters, he would notice that people would seem to be great in one thing, good in another and not so well in a third aspect, which led his inspiration to researching the possibility of multiple intelligences. Howard hypothesized that the multiple intelligences are a set of computers that all human beings have in their head, referring to a pluralistic view of the mind. He thought that once educators start to think about people and subject matter in a pluralistic sense, then they would be able to expand their methods of teaching. 
          </p>
    
        <p style="font-size:110%;">
          As an educator, Howard aims to end the stigma that is thinking that one is smart or dumb, rather, possessing a set of strengths and weaknesses. 
          </p>

  <!--Goal with theory-->
  <section id="Goal">
	  <body>
    	<h3>The Goal</h3>
        <p style="font-size:110%;">
        	To put it simply, the hope coming out of school, is that students leave school being able to recall well what they have learned. However, the hard truth is that unless students continue to maintain an active role in what they are studying, then the ideas and lessons disappear. Howard thinks that ways to execute this could be through constantly asking questions, hands-on learning and recreating their learnings in their own mind and transform them as needed. He believes in the notion that self directed study will adhere to a curious student; memorization will not stick. 
        	</p>
        
        <p style="font-size:110%;">
        	The theory of multiple intelligence stems from a psychological learning standpoint. It has been documented that humans have different intellectual strengths, and these strengths play a role in how kids learn and represent things in their mind (Gardner, 1993). Furthermore, it is thanks to these strengths that they are able to demonstrate their understanding of a topic. Howard toyed with the idea that it would only be fair to teach and assess everyone in the same manner if and only if everyone functioned on one form of intelligence. But as the theory explains, humans have the capability of operating from 8 different strengths. So long as the world could realize that everyone functions uniquely, then they would further realize how unjust the modern school system is. Howard believes that educators can shift to present materials to students in a way that supports their strengths and that everything can be taught and understood more than one way. However, this does not mean that he explicitly desires to teach in 8 different ways, so long as students understand the material then it is a success. 
        	</p>
        
        <p style="font-size:110%;">
        	Furthermore, Howard insists that students should be focusing on the importance of a process rather than the subject. He believes that schools teach too many subjects to contain. Using the example of sciences, it is okay to learn sciences such as chemistry and biology, but he thinks it is most important to understand how to think scientifically. For instance, understanding what makes a good hypothesis and revising a theory. Critical thinking like that takes time and it would be beneficial to a student to be able to bring that into a professional workplace where he claims they will be able to differ between an opinionated statement with a piece of evidence. 
        	</p>
            
        <p style="font-size:110%;">
        	Howard adds that there is often a gray area with the assessment of understanding what a student should be able to accomplish. He uses the example of athletes and the arts, in which throughout sports or music a student is clearly able to visualize or hear what the target expectation looks or sounds like. Moreover, students can be coached to the end goal and have visible improvement. Whereas in an educational setting, Howard claims assessment to be mystifying, where no one knows what will be on the test.

    	<h3>Howard's Solution</h3>
        <p style="font-size:110%;">
        	With the case of understanding student accomplishments, students should be able to reflect on their learning and assess how they can do better, encouraging open discussion. It is necessary for good examples to exist first to model for a new education system to thrive. In addition, good and better educators are important, these educators should want to be able to teach children in this expanded way. Instead of the classical teacher-centric style of learning, education should opt to shift to a child-centric style of learning where the educator is present, and the prior work is done behind the scenes. As for assessments, schemes should be enacted to complement the new style of learning and to prove that the new style is working. He points that it is rather redundant to have child-centric learning only to have the standard old-school tests. Lastly, it would be of great benefit for political commitment to state that learning through strengths and weaknesses is a goal to be accomplished.

    	<h3>Rebuttals Against the Multiple Intelligences</h3>
        <p style="font-size:110%;">
        	Unfortunately, many are not inline with Howard’s dream for a change in education, as his theory of multiple intelligences are being accused to be a neuromyth (Waterhouse, 2023). Neuromyths are unfounded claims about brain functions. The argument being that Howard’s theory lacked scientific intelligence that support the existence of separate brain-based intelligences. To add, there is no direct evidence that supports a brain bases for each proposed intelligence. The theory was based on outdated brain modularity theories but now clash with the current understandings of neuroscience. There is little to no evidence that demonstrated each intelligence being independent in the brain and overall, many believe that the theory is very under supported and lack standard scientific methods. 
        	</p>
        <p style="font-size:110%;">
        	Despite the lack of empirical support, many educators have still adopted the expansion of teaching through the theory of multiple intelligences. There is no evidence to whether it is an overall success but among many educators report a variation in success. Thus, selected educators will continue to teach in that fashion. All in all, from a scientific standpoint, it is agreed that no process can fully be set unless theories have provided empirical evidence suggesting adopting better teaching strategies (Waterhouse, 2023).
