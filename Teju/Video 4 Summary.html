<center><h2 style = "color: white; font-family: arial;">Video Summary</h2>
<p style = "margin: 50px 400px;color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">In this video, Noam Chomsky covers the topic of religion — specifically the concept of liberation theology. At the time of this video, the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall had recently been celebrated. Noam Chomsky discusses that shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall, there was another historic event that has been forgotten. </p>

<p style = "margin: 50px 400px;color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">This event was the murder of six leading Latin American intellectuals in a university by an Elite Salvadorian Battalion. It was an attempt to kill off liberation theology. Liberation theology is a religious movement that sought to liberate the oppressed and aid the poor. This is what Christianity originally was; however, it changed during the 4th century, when Christianity became the religion of the rich and powerful. It has been that ever since. 
 </p>

<p style = "margin: 50px 400px;color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">Chomsky explains that the murder of these theologists was significant because it was an attack on the restoration of Christianity. Moreover, it was fueled by the United States. He ends the video discussing the impact of the Liberation movement; however, its significant events are not commemorated.  </p>

<p style = "margin: 50px 400px;color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">Chomsky’s final statement is, “So keep away from clichés, this world is much more complicated”. This statement highlights the fact that much of our history is hidden from us. If this is true, how can we know what to believe about this world?
</p>


<h2 style = "color: white; font-family: arial;">Analysis</h2>
<p style = "margin: 50px 400px; color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">Chomsky’s concluding statement made me question how we can know what is true about our world. How do humans determine what we believe? And is it easy for us to change our minds?</p>
 
<p style = "margin: 0px 400px; color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">Paul Zak, a neuroscientist at Claremont University, says that our brains take facts and fit them to support our beliefs. If this is true, this means that individuals can be presented with the same information yet believe different things about them. 
 </p>

<p style = "margin: 50px 400px; color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">This can be applied to our history. People may differ in their beliefs about historical events. Some may believe that an event is significant while others may believe it is unimportant. This is the case of the liberation movement that Chomsky mentions., American leaders determined that this event was not significant, so they omitted it from the history books. This means that Americans are not taught this history which frames what they believe about the world. This is problematic because it means that individuals’ beliefs are largely in the hands of American leaders. Once we become aware of this fact, is it easy for us to change our beliefs and see the world differently? 
 </p>

<p style = "margin: 50px 400px; color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">Sharot et al. (2022), claim that belief change does not depend on the presentation of facts, it is a transaction. People compare the outcomes of changing the belief (i.e. positive/negative feelings) versus keeping the old belief (i.e. material loss/gain). If the new belief outweighs the old one, a person’s mind can be changed. This illustrates why it may be difficult for individuals to change their beliefs about our world’s past. The new beliefs about history may not outweigh the old ones. Perhaps becoming more critical about our history’s past, as Chomsky suggested, may benefit some people, resulting in a change in their beliefs. It is also possible that it will not benefit them, and their beliefs will stay the same.  </p>

<p style = "margin: 50px 400px; color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">Chomsky’s video highlighted the importance of being critical of our past. The information that is presented to us may be biased, so it is up to us to do our research and use that to determine whether belief change is beneficial.
