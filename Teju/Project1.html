<center><p style= "color: SlateGray; font-family:Didot; margin: 50px 300px;">In this video, Noam Chomsky explains that the advances in AI are useful for some purposes, but not when it comes to understanding language processing in humans. He mentions that one thing that AI has achieved is structure dependence. He explains that humans do not have this capacity through an example of a study done with German speakers. <p style= "color:SlateGray; font-family:Didot; margin: 50px 300px;">In this study, German speakers were given two invented languages, one based on human language structure and one based on a different structure, such as linear order. The participant's brains were observed while reading this language. The results showed that while reading the language that violates language rules, brain patterns appeared as if they were solving a puzzle, not understanding language. The results of this study reveal that the human brain is structured in a way where it expects certain things to be true; however, AI is able to achieve things that violate certain assumptions. </p></center>

<center><h2 style= "color:CadetBlue; font-family:Didot;"> My Opinions </h2></center>
<center><p style= "color: SlateGray; font-family:Didot; margin: 50px 300px;"> I agree with Chomsky’s viewpoints in this video. I believe that AI and the human mind are different and either one is stronger in different contexts. As Chomsky explained, AI may be better at handling problems that violate certain assumptions, such as understanding languages with different structures. There are also certain abilities where human minds are better. For example, adapting quickly to environmental changes. Like Chomsky, I believe that these differences may always be present as AI develops. <p style= "color: SlateGray; font-family:Didot; margin: 50px 300px;">Regarding his political work, I respect Chomsky because he uses his platform to speak about important humanitarian issues. Although this makes him “controversial”, I admire that he is a political activist and not afraid to be outspoken about his opinions. </p> </center>
