    <br><center><p style= "color: SlateGray; font-family:Didot; margin: 50px 300px;">Noam Chomsky, the father of modern linguistics, is known for his contributions to the field of linguistics and his critiques of political systems (Biography, 2023). 
In his early life, Chomsky was an intelligent child. Much of his work today is inspired by the injustices he witnessed at a young age. At the age of 10, Chomsky wrote a paper on the rise of fascism in Europe for his school newspaper and since then he has continued to share his brilliance with the world. <p style= "color: SlateGray; font-family:Didot; margin:50px 300px;">Chomsky earned his PhD in linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania. He began professing at MIT in 1955 and has produced groundbreaking theories concerning human linguistics ever since. Some of his linguistic revolutions include <a href ="https://www.thoughtco.com/transformational-grammar-1692557">Transformational Grammar</a>  and <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy">The Grammar Hierarchy.</a><p style= "color: SlateGray; font-family:Didot; margin: 50px 300px;">Chomsky uses a nativistic approach where he claims that certain abilities are hardwired into the brain (Costley, 2013). He believes that  language is innate, and children are better able to learn different languages because certain parameters develop over time in our brains. 
Chomsky is also known for his radical political views, in which he labels himself a libertarian socialist. He has published a variety of books based on social and political issues, such as <a href ="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/62666">American Power and the New Mandarins </a> and <a href =" https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/560-gaza-in-crisis"> Gaza in Crisis.</a><p style= "color: SlateGray; font-family:Didot; margin: 10px 300px;">Throughout his career, Chomsky has received a variety of awards. These include the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award, the Kyoto Prize and the humanitarian Sydney Peace Prize. Chomsky’s ideas are highly influential and that is why remains one of the most esteemed cognitive scientists (Biography, 2023). </a>

  <center><p style= "color: SlateGray; font-family:Didot; margin: 50px 300px;">In this video, Noam Chomsky explains that the advances in AI are useful for some purposes, but not when it comes to understanding language processing in humans. He mentions that one thing that AI has achieved is structure dependence. He explains that humans do not have this capacity through an example of a study done with German speakers. <p style= "color:SlateGray; font-family:Didot; margin: 50px 300px;">In this study, German speakers were given two invented languages, one based on human language structure and one based on a different structure, such as linear order. The participant's brains were observed while reading this language. The results showed that while reading the language that violates language rules, brain patterns appeared as if they were solving a puzzle, not understanding language. The results of this study reveal that the human brain is structured in a way where it expects certain things to be true; however, AI is able to achieve things that violate certain assumptions. </p></center>

<center><h2 style= "color:CadetBlue; font-family:Didot;"> My Opinions </h2></center>
<center><p style= "color: SlateGray; font-family:Didot; margin: 50px 300px;"> I agree with Chomsky’s viewpoints in this video. I believe that AI and the human mind are different and either one is stronger in different contexts. As Chomsky explained, AI may be better at handling problems that violate certain assumptions, such as understanding languages with different structures. There are also certain abilities where human minds are better. For example, adapting quickly to environmental changes. Like Chomsky, I believe that these differences may always be present as AI develops. <p style= "color: SlateGray; font-family:Didot; margin: 50px 300px;">Regarding his political work, I respect Chomsky because he uses his platform to speak about important humanitarian issues. Although this makes him “controversial”, I admire that he is a political activist and not afraid to be outspoken about his opinions. </p> </center>
