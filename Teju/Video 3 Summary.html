<center><h2 style = "color: white; font-family: arial;">Video Summary</h2>
<p style = "margin: 50px 400px;color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">In this video, Noam Chomsky explains what he believes being truly educated means. He opens the video by referencing Bill Hum von Humboldt, the founder of modern education. According to Humboldt, the core principle of a fulfilled human being is the ability to inquire and create constructively and independently without external controls. Therefore, true knowledge is the ability to do this.</p>

<p style = "margin: 50px 400px;color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">Following this, Chomsky mentions a quote by a leading physicist from MIT. The quote is, “It’s not important what we cover in class, it is important what you discover.” From this perspective, being truly educated is knowing where to look, how to look, how to question, how to challenge, and how to proceed independently. He also states that it is the ability to formulate serious questions.   
 </p>

<p style = "margin: 50px 400px;color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">Chomsky concludes the video by suggesting that this is the type of knowledge that the education system should cultivate. From kindergarten to graduate studies, students should learn how to inquire and create based on the resources available to them.  </p>


<h2 style = "color: white; font-family: arial;">Analysis</h2>
<p style = "margin: 50px 400px; color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">One popular question in the world of cognitive science is whether artificial intelligence is truly knowledgeable. According to Chomsky, true knowledge is the ability to inquire, create, and formulate questions independently. What Chomsky is describing is fluid intelligence; the ability to use your knowledge to solve novel problems. This contrasts with crystallized intelligence, which is accumulated knowledge that is problem-specific (Ghisletta & Lecerf, 2023).</p>
 
<p style = "margin: 50px 400px; color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">Currently, AI possesses crystallized intelligence. Through experience and practice, machines are able to increase their intelligence. However, is it possible for AI to have fluid intelligence? In February 2021, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology introduced a new neural network called “liquid” machine learning (Rosso, 2021). This class of machine learning is set to be more adaptable and able to solve complex real-world problems. The introduction of “liquid” intelligence shows that we may be on track to creating truly knowledgeable machines.  
 </p>

<p style = "margin: 50px 400px; color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">In Chomsky’s definition of knowledge, he uses the word ‘independently’. If AI can have fluid intelligence, this independence may be what sets humans and machines apart. Humans are naturally able to gain knowledge through experience; however, machines must be programmed and given data from a human to learn. I believe it may be possible for AI to eventually become independent. The field of artificial intelligence has had significant growth in the past few years. Therefore, our society may eventually encounter artificially intelligent machines that can spontaneously learn, create, and inquire. </p>
