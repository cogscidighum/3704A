<p style = "margin: 50px 400px;color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">In this comedic video, Noam Chomsky is interviewed by Ali G. He is asked six different questions related to language: 1) Why is studying language important? 2)When animals chat to each other, do they talk in language? 3) How many words do you know? 4) What are some of the words you know? 5) My cousin has a Bangladeshi mom and a dad from Staines. Do you think he’ll grow up speaking both languages? 6) Why don’t you create a new language?</p>

<p style = "margin: 50px 400px;color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">Chomsky raises some important points in response to these questions. He answers question one by saying that language is the core property that defines human beings. This leads to question two, which Chomsky answers by stating that it matters on your definition of “language”. Every organism has some means of communication.  
 </p>

<p style = "margin: 50px 400px;color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">In one of Ali G’s final questions, he uses a personal example to talk about bilingualism. Chomsky states that it varies among people, but in normal circumstances, a child whose parents speak different languages may grow up bilingual. He concludes his response by saying that each of us speaks many languages.</p>

<p style = "margin: 50px 400px;color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">Overall, this video uses humour to highlight some of the basic concepts surrounding language. </p>


<h2 style = "color: white; font-family: arial;">Analysis</h2>
<p style = "margin: 50px 400px; color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">Chomsky’s responses to these questions allude to there being a difference between “communication” and “language”. According to Surbhi (2018), communication is the interchange of information between two beings, either non-verbally or verbally. Alternately, language is a method of communication that people use to interact. </p>
 
<p style = "margin: 0px 400px; color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">This distinction aligns with Chomsky’s response to question two. He mentions that animals using language, “is a matter of definition”. He believes that every organism communicates. This shows that Chomsky believes that animals can communicate, but does he accept that some animals can use language? This depends on how Chomsky defines language. </p>

<p style = "margin: 50px 400px; color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">Chomsky defines language as a specific mental computational system that develops naturally (IEP, n.d.). While there have been instances of animals who can be taught certain forms of language (eg. apes and sign language), these methods of communication are not developed naturally. Therefore, Chomsky would reason that it is not truly language. </p>

<p style = "margin: 50px 400px; color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">In an interview with Chomsky and Matt Aames Cucchiaro, Chomsky argues against the idea of chimpanzee language. He states that teaching chimpanzees to communicate with sign language and considering their form of communication is an insult to chimpanzee intelligence (n.d., 2008). It is like teaching humans to dance like bees and saying they have learned to communicate. Furthermore, if apes do have the capacity to communicate with hand signs, why do they not use it?</p>

<p style = "margin: 50px 400px; color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">These responses demonstrate that Chomsky does not believe that animals use real language, which supports his claims in this video. All in all, Chomsky believes that there is a distinction between communication and language. Communication is used by every organism, while language is uniquely human.</p>
