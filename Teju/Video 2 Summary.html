<center><h2 style = "color: white; font-family: arial;">Video Summary</h2>
<p style = "margin: 50px 400px;color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">In this video, Noam Chomsky describes the history between Israel and the United States of America. He claims that this history is the reason why the U.S. continues to support Israel. Chomsky’s two main points are discussed below. </p>

<p style = "margin: 50px 400px;color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">His first point is that Christian Zionism dates earlier than Jewish Zionism. Christian Zionists used the bible to justify the Jewish colonization of Israel, as they claim it is what the bible commands. Since the United States is a majority Christian country, the relationship between Christian and Jewish Zionism is likely one of the reasons that the U.S. supports Israel. </p>

<p style = "margin: 50px 400px;color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">His second point is that all the settler colonial societies are Israel supporters. This includes England, the United States, Canada, and Australia. Israel gained this support in 1958 when there was a crisis in the region and Israel was the only state that cooperated with Britain. Chomsky believes that the support of Israel’s efforts is the last phase of European colonization. </p>

<p style = "margin: 50px 400px;color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">Chomsky concludes the video by raising an important point that concerns scientists. He explains that there is a tendency for academics to “go along like a herd” in support of the government, and those who oppose it are usually punished. His conclusion leaves viewers to question, if this statement is true, then is the intellectual information that is available to consumers generally biased?</p>


<h2 style = "color: white; font-family: arial;">Analysis</h2>
<p style = "margin: 50px 400px; color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">Even though this video was posted seven years ago, it is extremely relevant today. This video answers the question as to why Canada and the U.S. are in support of Israel in its conflict with Palestine. There is a history there, so these countries will likely always support each other. </p>

<p style = "margin: 50px 400px; color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">When Chomsky stated that Israel’s conflict with Palestine is the “last phase of European colonization,” it was eye-opening as currently Palestinians are being killed and pushed out of Gaza. This gave me a new perspective that maybe colonization is still happening today. </p>

<p style = "margin: 50px 400px; color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">Chomsky’s concluding statement on the conformity of intellectuals calls to question whether this is the case in terms of research. Is research biased? And does this apply to research in cognitive science? This may be the case due to the file drawer problem and publication bias. Journals can determine which research becomes published and it favours studies with statistically significant results (Franco et al., 2017). This means that the information we access is skewed towards positive findings and this influences what we believe is true. </p>

<p style = "margin: 50px 400px; color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">Overall, biased information can affect what society believes politically, socially, and scientifically. Chomsky stating that mainstream intellectuals do not have “independent minds” is important because it urges individuals to become aware of this reality and more critical of the information they consume.  </p>
