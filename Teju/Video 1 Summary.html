<p style = "margin: 50px 400px;color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">In this video, Al Page asks Noam Chomsky various questions concerning language. Page asks Chomsky eight different questions: 1) why is French different than German? 2) How does language change over time? 3) What does it mean when French people say they want to keep language pure? 4) Why does language have rules? 5) Why is pronunciation so important to language? 6) What role does slang play in language? 7) How does language differ in the way it’s used in the arts? 8) How should parents expose their children to language?  </p>

<p style = "margin: 50px 400px;color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">Chomsky makes some important points in response to these questions. One significant response was to question three. Chomsky stated that most Western language speakers believe that their language is the only “good language”; however, there is no such thing as a “language” — only different ways of speaking. The assignment of some languages as “good” has no linguistic meaning, only sociopolitical. This means that we only perceive some ways of speaking as better because there is prestige associated with them 
 </p>

<p style = "margin: 50px 400px; color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">Chomsky explains this further by using African American Vernacular English (AAVE) as an example. He says that we only perceive AAVE as “not proper” because “White English” has more prestige. If Black people were at the top of society, Black English would be respected.</p>

<p style = "margin: 50px 400px; color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">Chomsky makes another significant claim in response to question four. Chomsky states that the language rules they teach in school are false — that is why they must teach them. These grammar rules are unnatural which means it is not “real language”. His example is using the phrase, “he and I”. Naturally, people would say “him and me” but we are taught in school that this is incorrect even though it is unnatural for us.</p>
<p style = "margin: 50px 400px; color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">Chomsky concludes this video with his response to question eight. Chomsky explains that children can be molded; however, if you leave them alone, they will naturally pick up the language of their environment. This means there is little parents can do to change the course of a child’s linguistic development. This leaves viewers to question whether encouraging language development really makes a difference. According to Chomsky, it may be possible that children will pick up language regardless. </p>

<h2 style = "color: white; font-family: arial;">Analysis</h2>
<p style = "margin: 50px 400px; color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">Chomsky’s theory of universal grammar explains why he made such a response to question eight. His theory states that the mind is pre-equipped with linguistic rules that are common across all languages (Main, 2023). This means children grasp grammatical rules and structures instinctively, which makes it easy for them to acquire language. </p>
 
<p style = "margin: 0px 400px; color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">In the video, Chomsky conveyed a common theme that language does not need to be taught. It is natural to humans and if it needs to be taught, then it is not “real” language. This is contradictory to the behaviourist view. Behaviourists believe that reinforcement is crucial for language development. So, how do we know which perspective to take?  
 </p>

<p style = "margin: 50px 400px; color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">Parents and teachers who follow the behaviourist view are more prescriptive in the way they teach their children. They may emphasize teaching proper grammar and may correct their children when they make linguistic errors. In contrast, parents and teachers who follow Chomsky’s view allow their children to develop language naturally. Since children pick up the language of their environment, parents may immerse their children in language by engaging in conversation with and around them. Furthermore, they may not teach them language rules as they expect their child to pick them up instinctively. 


 </p>

<p style = "margin: 50px 400px; color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">Is one of way teaching language better than the other? In a meta-analysis by Roberts and Kaiser (2011), they determined that parent-implemented language interventions have a significant positive impact on children’s language skills. This finding supports the behaviourist view on language development; however, this does not mean that Chomsky is wrong. </p>

<p style = "margin: 50px 400px; color: white; font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">I believe that there is an interplay between universal grammar and reinforcement. This means that children are born equipped to learn language and left alone they may learn it naturally; however, reinforcement can facilitate acquisition. All in all, Chomsky’s theories about language are revolutionary. They show that children are natural language learners. Nonetheless, it may be more effective for parents and teachers to incorporate a behaviourist perspective as well as they go about teaching language.
