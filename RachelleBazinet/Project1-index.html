    <h3 style="color:DarkSlateBlue;font-family: monaco, monospace; text-align:center;"> Brief overview & Academic Biography </h3>
    <br>
    <p style="color: MidnightBlue;font-family: monaco, monospace;"> Philosophy of mind has puzzled many academics throughout history. From Renee Descartes's Dualism to Hilary Putnam’s Computational Functionalism, this debate has given rise to various different views on how thought is connected to the brain. 
      Among these philosophers, there is one in particular that will be the focus of today. Patricia Smith Churchland is a Canadian-American known for taking a neuroscientific view on the classic mind-body problem in philosophy. 
      This position is called Eliminative Materialism, which postulates the ultimate reduction of the entirety of the folk psychology framework to the neuroscientific underpinnings of the brain. 
      Churchland earned her Bachelor’s degree in Arts at the University of British Columbia and continued her education where she obtained her Master’s degree in Arts at the University of Pittsburg (Braund, 2008). 
      She then studied at Oxford University and gained her Bachelor of Philosophy, a post-graduate degree involving a supervised research project or a thesis. Throughout her career, the neurophilosopher gained numerous awards and has had many publications (Braund, 2008).

    <h2 style="color:DarkSlateBlue;font-family: monaco, monospace; text-align:center;"> Summary of "The Brains Behind Morality" </h2>
    <br>
    <p style="color: MidnightBlue;font-family: monaco, monospace;"> The focus will be on the TED talk based on her book entitled “Braintrust – What Neuroscience Tells Us About Morality”. 
      To begin, there will be an overview of the TED talk, focusing on the main points made by Churhcland. Secondly, there will be a critical analysis of two components that she mentions in the video. 
      Finally, I will provide a short discussion about the content overall. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p style="color: MidnightBlue;font-family: monaco, monospace;"> In her TED presentation titled "The Brains Behind Morality," Patricia Churchland delves into the origins of moral motivation and values. 
      She initiates her discourse by raising questions about the phenomenon of altruistic behaviour observed in humans and other mammals, wherein individuals willingly sacrifice personal resources for the welfare of others. 
      She counters the traditional notion that attributes the source of morality to religion, elucidating that organized religious systems emerged relatively late in human history. At the same time, more rudimentary moral norms were present within early hunter-gatherer societies. 
      Churchland posits that the roots of moral motivation can be traced back to the process of evolution, specifically in the context of the emergence of warm-blooded creatures. This transformation necessitated a heightened level of intelligence and increased parental care for vulnerable offspring. 
      As animals advanced in intelligence, they concurrently developed the capacity to care for others, thereby fostering profound bonds between parents and their offspring. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p style="color: MidnightBlue;font-family: monaco, monospace;"> Churchland also underscores the significance of oxytocin, a pivotal hormone in maternal bonding, which concurrently plays a role in the formation of social bonds between mates and within familial structures. 
      Diverse species exhibit varying degrees of sociality, influenced by ecological factors and the distribution of oxytocin receptors in the brain. Furthermore, Churchland delves into the process through which children acquire moral norms via social inclusion and the rewarding aspects of cooperation. 
      She underscores the role of storytelling in transmitting these norms and the influence of natural opioids in reinforcing prosocial behaviours while mitigating stress. It is important to note that, while neuroscience can offer valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underpinning sociality and morality, it does not provide definitive answers to specific moral dilemmas or questions. 
      Ultimately, moral decisions continue to be addressed through human deliberation, negotiation, and the application of common sense as individuals grapple with complex ethical issues. In conclusion, Churchland's presentation sheds light on the evolutionary and neurological foundations of morality, all the while recognizing the ongoing human responsibility in making moral choices.

    <h2 style="color:DarkSlateBlue;font-family: monaco, monospace; text-align:center;"> Critical Analysis </h2>
    <br>
    <p style="color: MidnightBlue;font-family: monaco, monospace;"> In the video, Churhcland raises a typical response to her query about the origins of morality, namely, that it came from organized religion. 
      Although she acknowledges the validity of this response, she eventually dismisses it. Churchland notes that organized religion has only been a part of civilization for around the last 10,000 years and that altruistic behaviour has existed for as long as people have. 
      Given how recently religion has emerged in terms of the origins of humanity, this is a reasonable objection. Instead, she makes the point that religion has grown out of people's inherent altruism. 
      To provide evidence for this argument, the speaker mentions how even Inuit communities living in the Arctic possess moral ideas. Even though these societies are isolated from the outside world, they nevertheless display moral behaviour that is acceptable everywhere else. 
      This supports the idea that morality appears to be ingrained in all living things, particularly humans. Instead of encouraging humanity's innate capacity for compassion, religion is only built upon it. 
      The development of agriculture and the need for stable communities among hunter-gatherer civilizations led to the emergence of organized religion. In conclusion, given the data presented, I concur with her critique of this argument.

    <h3 style="color: MidnightBlue;font-family: monaco, monospace; text-align:center;"> Oxytocin </h3>
    <br>
    <p style="color: MidnightBlue;font-family: monaco, monospace;"> In her TED talk lecture, Churchland primarily discusses the impact of the chemical oxytocin on the brain. More specifically, she argues that the neurological structure of the brain was impacted in a lasting way by the evolutionary process that resulted in the formation of warm-blooded creatures. 
      The neurophilosopher points out that because warm-blooded creatures need roughly ten times as much food as cold-blooded species do, their brains must evolve to be able to adapt and learn. 
      Churchland talks about how genetic modifications can provide animals with the ability to adapt more quickly to environmental stresses. 
      An animal can adapt to the causal structure of the universe by first growing and arranging its neurons and then making sure that this neural growth happens after birth. Newborns' vulnerability is a challenge despite the benefits of this heightened learning capability. 
      To remedy this, intelligent adults take care of these helpless newborns. Strong relationships between parents and their fragile offspring were made possible by a change in neurological wiring, which resulted in a shift in values from self-oriented to other-oriented. 
      When endogenous opioids are released in conjunction, the brain experiences both pleasure and pain, which strengthens the link. An important bonding hormone, oxytocin, contributes to the formation of social ties between partners and family members. 
      Churchland also stressed the value of social standards, that children pick up organically and the satisfying nature of teamwork in resolving conflicts within social groupings. The brain chemical responsible for morality is oxytocin. 
      She shows how oxytocin receptors and levels impact parent-offspring and mate bonding using the example of prairie voles versus mountain voles.

    <h3 style="color: MidnightBlue;font-family: monaco, monospace; text-align:center;"> Prairie Voles </h3>
    <br>
    <p style="color: MidnightBlue;font-family: monaco, monospace;"> Upon a thorough examination of her primary thesis concerning the origins of morality, I find myself in agreement. She adeptly elucidates the role of evolution in shaping the human brain, which subsequently influences interpersonal behaviour among humans. 
      The emergence of morality is revealed as a trait that bears evolutionary advantages, thereby ensuring its perpetuation across generations. 
      Individuals possess an inherent inclination to affiliate with specific groups or communities due to the inherent satisfaction derived from such associations. 
      The case study involving prairie and mountain voles explicitly demonstrates the pivotal role of oxytocin in adherence to moral and social norms necessary for community cohesion. 
      Patricia Churchland effectively communicates the brain's central role in the realm of morality, bolstered by her illustrative use of examples that elucidate the rationale behind the significance of oxytocin in fostering altruistic conduct. 
      Furthermore, she delves into the evolutionary processes responsible for the development of this neural architecture. 
      It is only reasonable to conclude that the evolutionary advantages stemming from parent-offspring bonding extend to interactions with strangers in society, as it ultimately contributes to the survival of our species

    <br>
    <p style="color: MidnightBlue;font-family: monaco, monospace;"> In summary, the essay delved into Patricia Churchland's TED talk, where she explored the neurobiological underpinnings of morality. To begin, the speaker's background was introduced to contextualize her position in the field of cognitive science. 
      Following this, a concise overview highlighted key points from the video. Once this foundation was established, a thorough examination of two key ideas presented by Churchland was conducted. 
      The first idea challenged the notion of religion as the primary source of moral behaviour in humans. The second, arguably the most significant aspect, centred on the role of oxytocin in promoting selfless actions. 
      Churchland substantiated her arguments with various examples, elucidating the origins of oxytocin and its impact on the social norms associated with morality. 
      Personally, I found both of her arguments compelling due to their strong logical reasoning and substantial evidential support. In conclusion, Patricia Churchland delivered a comprehensive talk elucidating the origins and neuroscientific basis of morality.
