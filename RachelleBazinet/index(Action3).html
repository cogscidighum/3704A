    <p>In her TEDxNorrköping talk titled "The Brains Behind Morality," Patricia Churchland explores the origins of moral motivation and values. She begins by questioning why humans, as well as other mammals, exhibit altruistic behaviour, sacrificing personal resources for the benefit of others. Contrary to the notion that religion is the source of morality, she highlights that organized religions emerged relatively late in human history, and simpler moral norms existed within hunter-gatherer societies.
    Churchland argues that the roots of moral motivation lie in evolution, particularly in the development of warm-blooded animals, which required increased intelligence and parental care for vulnerable offspring. As animals became smarter, they also developed the capacity to care for others, fostering bonding between parents and offspring. She explains that oxytocin, a hormone critical for maternal bonding, also plays a role in forming social bonds between mates and within families. 
    Different species exhibit varying levels of sociality, influenced by ecological conditions and oxytocin receptor distribution in the brain. Furthermore, Churchland discusses how children acquire moral norms through social inclusion and the rewarding experience of cooperation. She emphasizes the importance of storytelling in transmitting these norms and the role of natural opioids in reinforcing social behaviours and reducing stress.
    While neuroscience can provide insights into the neural mechanisms underlying sociality and morality, it cannot answer specific moral questions or dilemmas. Moral decisions are still addressed through human deliberation, negotiation, and common sense, as individuals grapple with complex ethical issues. In conclusion, Churchland's talk sheds light on the evolutionary and neurological basis of morality while acknowledging the ongoing human responsibility of making moral choices.</p>
