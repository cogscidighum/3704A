        Bret Weinstein has studied and worked in the field of evolutionary biology for decades. Although he no longer teaches in the traditional sense, his platform online aims to educate viewers and discuss questions about human nature and our future. Understanding someone's perspective requires a comprehensive analysis of the information they've put out in various contexts, both on their own platforms and in response to others.  Dr. Weinstein has uploaded almost 500 videos on his YouTube channel which has 440,000 subscribers. He is also a sought-after guest on many popular podcasts such as The Joe Rogan Experience, Armchair expert, The Rubin Report, and more. The controversy which led to his rise to celebrity status is also the subject of a three-part documentary entitled ‘The devils of Evergreen State College.’ 
    </p>


    <p>
As there are hundreds of videos to choose from, I opted to view a variety of content including the documentary, an assortment of his most popular videos, as well as a selection of his earliest and latest uploads to get a feel for his point of view as a celebrity scientist over time. His most watched video by far was his testimony to Congress regarding the Evergreen State College riots, which has been viewed more than 2.1 million times since being posted in 2018.
</p>
<p>
Some context for the Evergreen State College situation feels necessary before the analysis of Weinstein’s viewpoint can be understood. Evergreen was a leader in experimental university practices, implementing unorthodox approaches to teaching and creating community on campus.   When a new president was hired at the college, however, he began making administrative changes which culminated in the creation of an equity council which operated under the belief that white individuals are innately racist and that this reality needs to be tackled head on.  Among the strategies for tacking this were mandatory self evaluations in which professors were required to rate their own levels of racism to be tracked on their records. In the past, a day of absence was observed at the university where staff and students of colour could choose to remain off campus in order to draw attention to the importance of their roles. In 2017 however, the new directive was sent by the equity council via email and stated that this year, the day of absence was mandatory and would exclude anyone white rather than people of colour making the choice about their attendance. This had been the final straw for Weinstein and he spoke out about the absurdity of excluding people based on the colour of their skin, stating in an email to the council that “one’s right to speak, or to be, must never be based on skin color.”  Weinstein’s opposition created backlash which concluded in demands for his resignation and protests-turned-riots at the university, all of which were supported by the new president. The president had also instructed the police not to intervene when the following day the rioters were hunting Weinstein by patrolling the route he was known to take and stopping and searching cars on campus. Luckily, Weinstein wasn’t found, but the experiences left a lasting mark.

 In Weinstein's testimony to congress in his most popular video, he recounts the incident at Evergreen State where he had been a tenured professor a year before. The testimony delved into the concept of equity and its weaponization. Weinstein argues that opposing any ill-considered equity proposal will lead to accusations of racism, stifling free speech and preventing open discussion. He suggests that this particular ideology is gaining influence on campuses, limiting the diversity of perspectives through outright policies or more subtly peer pressure. 
</p>
    <p>

His testimony included a discussion of ‘safe spaces’ and how this phrase could be interpreted. Currently, he says, a ‘safe space’ is a place in which one is free from that which offends them, however a better approach would be to ensure there are ‘safe spaces’ for in depth discussion without fear of reprimand. 
</p>
    <p>

Weinstein stresses that discussions about free speech on college campuses are just a part of a broader issue – what he considers to be a breakdown in the basic logic of civilization. The breakdown, according to him, is not limited to campuses; it's spreading into various sectors including the legal system and the tech industry.
</p>
 <p>

Weinstein states that the root cause of this breakdown lies in the failure to address toxic and ill-conceived ideas when they first emerged in academia. Instead of challenging them, the creation of fields that sustain them has allowed them to gain influence. He believes that the acceptance of relativism, where all truths are considered equal, poses a severe threat to civilization. He insists we recognize the significance of this issue beyond campuses and confront these ideas to prevent a further breakdown in the functioning of society.

Throughout the content that Weinstein has produced, this theme seems to be the common thread. His Youtube channel was created in 2014 but he didn’t start uploading content until just after the controversy in 2017. His first video outlines the purpose and scope of his channel. He addresses speculation about whether the channel will focus on politics or biology, clarifying that while he is interested in politics, he will approach it from a biological perspective. Weinstein mentions that the channel is for those interested in asking questions, particularly those who may not think of themselves as scientifically minded initially.

</p>
 <p>
Weinstein reflects on his belief that humans are born with an innate capacity for scientific thinking. He states that his channel intends to explore various topics, including basic evolutionary frameworks, fun or important questions related to human evolution, difficult questions about war and oppression, and speculative questions about humanity's future. 
</p>
 <p>
The early videos posted rely heavily on Dr. Weinstein’s background as an evolutionary biologist, such as exploring the evolutionary basis of gratitude, or an evolutionary approach to good governance. As time progresses, however, Weinstein’s content tends to veer away from his academic background in evolutionary biology into broader discussions about the state and future of our species in regards to diverse challenges we face. Four years ago in 2019, he began uploading his Dark Horse Podcast to his YouTube channel, and from the beginning, there doesn’t seem to be much focus on biology and instead a heavy interest in discussing the current state of humanity. It seems as though rather than looking at the world with an evolutionary lens, Weinstein has adopted a perspective which has its roots in his experience at Evergreen and his deep fear and hatred of what he perceives to be authoritarian powers. 
</p>
 <p>

As the COVID pandemic came to a head, Weinstein’s beliefs rooted in the dangers of authoritarianism coloured his perspective. Weinstein seemed convinced the virus was created in a lab, opposed the vaccine mandates and gained notoriety after appearing on the Joe Rogan Experience Podcast to discuss the benefits of Ivermectin as a COVID cure. As a result of his outspoken views, Weinstein drew backlash from the majority of academics and experts in the field.  


</p>
 <p>
By 2023, Weinstein’s uploads become harder and harder to engage with on a rational level. He recently released a podcast ‘from the vault’ that was initially recorded in 2021 where he joyously welcomed antivax advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to discuss the new book Kennedy had penned: ‘The Real Anthony Fauci: Bill Gates, Big Pharma, and the Global War on Democracy and Public Health.’ One interpretation of the delay in the release of this episode could be that he has become more comfortable with the content since it’s recording and is now willing to align himself more fully with these views. Recent uploads have almost no link to the initial mission statement for the YouTube channel – to apply an evolutionary lens to the world of today. 
</p>
 <p>
The troubling aspect of Weinstein’s content is that small chunks of it in isolation do make sense, but when a broader assortment of materials is analyzed, the flaws become glaringly apparent. So much of it is entirely reasonable in theory, but when put into practice the reality of trying to draw a line between what is reasonable and what is foolhardy becomes a subjective decision rather than an objective truth. The building blocks of logic are present; however some arguments are based on what appear to be subjective premises and opinions rather than facts. It’s a shame that an individual who has his level of expertise as an evolutionary theorist as well as his logical abilities has been shaped so dramatically by his negative experiences and now seems to have a fairly one-dimensional view of the world. 
</p>
 <p>
When we engage with anyone, be it a celebrity scientist, a politician, or even a friend – it is essential that we analyze ideas on an case-by-case basis rather than aligning ourselves with a person or ideology as a whole. It is possible and even likely that one person will hold views that are correct about some things and incorrect about others. The tendency to categorize belief sets as entirely right or entirely wrong is polarizing and leads to shallow levels of thought. Fostering a commitment to nuanced analysis will encourage a more thoughtful and open-minded approach to understanding the true complexities of the world
