    <div id="output2"> Abstract: Dr. Bret Weinstein is a polarizing character in the world of online celebrity scientists. He has studied and worked in the field of evolutionary biology for decades and currently aims to apply the tools of science he’s familiar with to explore questions about human nature and our future.
Along with his friend Alexandros Marinos, Weinstein discussed this on a recent podcast entitled “The Dawn of AGI” in an episode where they talked about the possibilities and risks posed by the use of artificial intelligence, as well as the challenges in handling such innovations in a responsible manner. In this friendly debate, Weinstein takes a more wary perspective whereas Marinos tends to be more optimistic about the possibilities of future uses of AI. Although the title of the podcast is the ‘Dawn of AGI’ (Artificial General Intelligence), it was acknowledged that this does not (yet) exist, and Marinos has doubts that this sort of generalized machine intelligence is possible at all.
