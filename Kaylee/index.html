</div>
<div class="center">
<p align= "justify" style= "color:midnightblue; font-family:Georgia, serif;">Anil Seth is a British neuroscientist and a professor of Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience at the University of Sussex in England. He is well known for his research and field work that have a primary focus on building a further understanding of the nature of consciousness, as well as the impacts of perception and self-awareness on the brain. His main research goal is to solve the mystery of how the human brain creates subjective experiences of the world, “and to use these insights from consciousness science for the benefit of society, technology, and medicine” (Anil Seth, n.d.). Seth has published over 200 academic publications and has been recognized as the Web Of Science Highly Cited Researcher in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022; an award given to the top 0.1% of scientists and social scientists based on the impact of their research (Anil Seth, n.d.). Seth’s work, including various book releases, podcasts, documentaries, TED Talks, articles, and media appearances have made a significant contribution to one of the greatest ongoing challenges of 21st century science - the mystery of consciousness. </p>

<h2 style= "color:midnightblue" "font-family:Georgia, serif"><u>TED Talk Summary</u></h2>
</div>
<div class="center">
<p align ="justify" style= "color:midnightblue; font-family:Georgia, serif;"> In this TED Talk, neuroscientist Anil Seth investigates the mysteries of consciousness as well as the complex and dependent relationship between consciousness, the brain, and body. Seth argues in his theory that our conscious experiences are merely controlled hallucinations generated by the brain in its role as a “prediction engine” (TED, 2017). By the term prediction engine, Seth is referring to the process and mechanisms that the brain constantly uses to predict the causes of sensory input and to shape our conscious contents (Do, 2021). He uses the example of colour illusion to demonstrate the brain’s tendency to use perception — the process of making informed guesses — in which the brain combines sensory signals with memories of previous experiences of the world to form its best idea of what around us caused those signals and to  change what we consciously experience. Seth shows the crowd two gray-coloured panels on a checkerboard that appear to be very different shades of gray, however he argues that the two panels are in fact the exact same colour. He proves his argument by showing the crowd an altered version of the checkerboard image with the two gray patches joined by a gray-coloured bar, showing that the two panels are the same shade of gray, however our perception is altered due to shadows casted by external objects onto the checkerboard. Seth goes on to explain that this colour illusion/hallucination is caused by the brain playing its role as a prediction engine using its prior expectations that are built deeply into the circuits of the visual cortex enabling us to perceive the colour as lighter than it really is. <br>
<p align ="justify" style= "color:midnightblue; font-family:Georgia, serif;"> Seth then moves on to discuss how rather than the brain passively receiving sensory information, it has an active and constructive prediction process that can lead to controlled hallucinations, such as sense of self, that then subsequently shape our perception of reality. He emphasizes that our sense of self is a direct result of consciousness, and without consciousness, “there’s no world, there’s no self, there’s nothing at all” (TED, 2017). Seth believes that our consciousness as humans has less to do with pure intelligence and more to do with our nature as living and breathing organisms. He states, “once we start explaining its properties in terms of things happening inside brains and bodies, the apparently insoluble mystery of what consciousness is should start to fade away” (TED, 2017). The experiences of the body from the inside are very different from the experiences of the external world around us as perception of the internal state of the body is grounded in the control and regulation of physiological variables. When the brain uses predictions to control and regulate the things it perceives, we experience a sense of direction in our control, however when the brain uses predictions to examine the world around us, we inevitably perceive external objects as the cause of our sensations. Therefore, the most basic experience of a sense of self is nothing more than a controlled hallucination that is deeply grounded in the many biological mechanisms that keep us alive.  <br>
<p align ="justify" style= "color:midnightblue; font-family:Georgia, serif;"> Seth explains that although many people believe the experience of being a person is familiar due to the rich set of social interactions and memories they have collected in the past, many psychology and neuroscience experiments show that these different ways in which we experience being a person can be deceiving and can be separated into parts with their own predictive processes. He further discusses his point of the brain generating the conscious experience of being and having a body by using the example of the famous neuroscience experiment, the rubber hand illusion. In the rubber hand illusion experiment, a person’s hand is hidden from their view and replaced with a fake rubber hand. Both the hidden real hand and the fake rubber hand are simultaneously stroked with a paintbrush while the person stares at the rubber hand. For most people in this experiment, this sight leads to a hallucination of the fake hand being a part of their own body. This is thought to be due to the similarity between the sight and sensation of touch on an object that both appears like a hand and is in the position a hand would normally be in. This is enough evidence for the brain to make an educated prediction that the rubber hand is part of the body, therefore shaping the person’s conscious contents into a false reality.  <br>
<p align ="justify" style= "color:midnightblue; font-family:Georgia, serif;"> Finally, Seth highlights the importance of interoception in our understanding of consciousness. He explains interoception as the perception of all of the internal body states that we experience from within, such as the sensory signals inside of the body that continuously communicate the internal state of the heart, organs, blood pressure, etc. with the brain (TED, 2017). The brain generates the sensation of all of our experiences, including interoception, which is often overlooked as an impacting factor in consciousness, yet our perception of our internal state is critical for our physiological homeostasis and our survival. <br>
<p align ="justify" style= "color:midnightblue; font-family:Georgia, serif;"> Overall, in his TED Talk, Anil Seth explored a variety of explanations behind the mystery of consciousness that he has spent decades of his career researching. While the direct cause of consciousness still remains unsolved, his hard work has furthered our scientific understanding of the brain as a prediction engine, driving our predictive processes to distinguish between the perception of external objects and the regulation and control of internal states as they define our conscious existence within the world.
