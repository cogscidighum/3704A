<u><h2>Video 1: Can science explain consciousness and reality?</h2></u>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KzchHqEEh1I?si=9eOwf6AuUqhO6Xqq" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br><p>In this video, Anil Seth discusses the common misconceptions about the differences between consciousness, intelligence and reality. He begins by providing the example of the misconception that artificial intelligence (AI) is conscious. He explains that many people fear advancements in AI because they think that consciousness and intelligence are the same concept, but this belief is false. Often, people confuse experiences like memories, intelligence and learning—which are all experiences of self—with the experience of consciousness (The Institute of Art and Ideas, 2022). Seth notes that this high-level of self that humans experience differs from what constitutes the basic experience of consciousness, and that AI is not capable of such a high-level of self. <br> 
<br>Interestingly, he then explains his viewpoint of the experience of consciousness being merely a hallucination generated by the brain in its efforts to perceive the sensory input coming from outside the body. It is important to note that this view could also be easily misunderstood, as Seth is referring to the brain constinously and actively constructing controlled hallucination-like states in response to objective reality, not literal hallucinations. One’s idea of consciousness can be very different from another person’s due to the differences in objective realities and factors that affect perception such as drugs or mental disorders (The Institute of Art and Ideas, 2022). <br> 
<br>The famous philosophical problem, the hard problem of consciousness, is analogous to Seth’s view on consciousness, but it is still not enough to provide a sufficient scientific explanation of consciousness as a whole. He highlights that in order to understand the complexities of consciousness, one must also look at the problem from many different angles. The mystery of consciousness is one that must be solved collaboratively with valuable insights and different methodologies from each discipline within cognitive science.

<u><h2>Video 2: How do our brains perceive the world around us?</h2></u>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EWEwpS8L5Cw?si=uxEGA_7pwwLRTrQM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br><p>In this video, Anil Seth discusses the current ideas in science on how the brain translates visual signals into conscious experience. Seth makes his well-known argument that the human brain is a ‘prediction machine’ with a system of various processes and mechanisms it uses to continuously predict the causes of sensory input and therefore shape our conscious experiences. He explains that perception is a process of inference, where the brain continuously makes and updates predictions about the world through its previously interpreted signals. Our brains perceive the world by combining prior expectations with sensory information, resulting in a best guess of the causes of sensory signals (The Royal Institution, 2021). These perceptions can be viewed as ‘hallucinations’ or a form of uncontrolled perception, caused by strong predictions overwhelming the sensory information in the brain. <br>
<br>It is important to note that the brain is not perfect and can sometimes make errors, therefore prediction errors of sensory signals are not uncommon. It is possible for the brain to make prediction errors about objects, colours, shapes, time, space, and even our sense of selves. Again, this can be an issue for people on illicit drugs/prescription medications, or people with eyesight problems, mental illness, or brain injury, as one’s perception can easily be altered to change the way their brain perceives sensory signals (The Royal Institution, 2021). 
</p>
<u><h2>Video 3: The scientific problem of consciousness</h2></u>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CJhSSPO8Ulk?si=x-UYq_3f4QMX3si2" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br><p>The scientific problem of consciousness is one that has puzzled every field within cognitive science for centuries. From philosophers, to neuroscientists, and psychologists, no field has been able to fully solve the mystery yet, however, some advancements in neuroscience have recently been made. Through the use of brain imaging methods, neuroscience researchers have made progress in understanding the neural basis of consciousness and where/why consciousness occurs in the brain. For example, we now know that the measures of brain dynamics, such as brain complexity, can provide an approximation of how conscious someone is. This is now a measure used in healthcare by doctors to analyze a patient’s level of consciousness following an injury or illness (Quanta Magazine, 2021). <br>
<br>
However, the question of what are subjective experiences still remains unanswered. Seth mentions that treating consciousness as a scientific problem, similar to how biologists approach the study of life, may help solve the ongoing philosophy-based hard problem of consciousness (the problem of subjective experience). The hard problem of consciousness is one that has puzzled scientists for centuries, as it tries to explain subjective experiences like the color yellow, the feeling of jealousy, or simply what is it like to be an organism having a conscious experience (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, n.d.). It has been difficult for scientists to explain the relationship between physical phenomena such as brain processes, and experience such as mental states or consciousness. Seth notes that many of the terms used in the making of the definition of consciusness are functionally definable, but due to the subjectiveness of consciousness, the definition of consciousness is deeply personal and changes depending on who you ask. For now, he believes that viewing consciousness from a scientific point of view is making the most significant progress towards a concrete solution, but consciousness may mark the limit as to how much science can explain.

<u><h2>Video 4: How your brain invents your "self"</h2></u>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z7_LwuuPsAE?si=02ZaoeMNU8drOvCA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br><p>In this video, Anil Seth focuses on what it means to be a conscious entity and to have a sense of self. Again, he explains his theory that the experience of self is a controlled hallucination created by the brain through predictions and perceptions. Seth claims that our experiences of the world are not direct representations, but rather our brain’s best guesses that are influenced by previous usefulness of sensory signals. The experience of self is harder to define than our experiences of the world because our experience of self is a multi-layered composition of various perceptual predictions, such as continuous personal identity, free will, perspective, embodiment, and emotion (TED, 2021). <br>
<br>
Seth then highlights that our perception is a continuously active construction that is focused on regulating and controlling the body for survival purposes. Then, he notes that the brain needs perception to keep the body alive, but the brain does not always remember conscious experience, and rather partakes in a process called memory chunking to remember the most important sensory signals from throughout the day. This can be beneficial in the studies of basic neuroscience, as well as for the survival of people with memory loss or impairments to predict what high-prioirity information from throughout the day form memories in the experience of self to help with their care (TED, 2021). Finally, Seth ends on the important note that the human brain is not a cognitive computer, but rather a ‘feeling machine’. Without perception as input in the brain, there would be no experience of self, as the brain relies on perception from sensory signals to create its sense of self (TED, 2021). 
</p>
<u><h2>Video 5: How we build perception from the inside out</h2></u>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfOu14wIvM4?si=WrbwgTtSBMl0H6JM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br><p>In this video, Anil Seth once again discusses the conscious experience and how our perceptions come to be. He explains his theory that consciousness is a subjective experience, and what we perceive is not truthful, but rather a construction within the brain. He gives the example of colours, and how the brain perceives visual sensory signals from the inside out, therefore allowing our visual systems to adaptively interact with the world. The memory then replays from previous signals to allow the brain to make further predictions and shape our subjective experience of said colour (Aeon Video, 2020). <br>
<br>
The relationship between the mind and body is one that has been studied extensively for decades, yet there is still no concrete answer to the hard problem of consciousness (Aeon Video, 2020). The theory that we create our perceptions of reality has been examined by other scientists and philosophers in recent years, most notably by the cognitive psychologist Donald Hoffman, who famously argues that if we construct our experiences of colours, shapes, tastes, and objects, then we ourselves are also constructions within our own brains (Allan, 2022). However, Seth ends the video with noting that while there is some new research emerging on the conscious experience, it is important for there to be further research conducted to fully understand the depths of the complex relationship between the conscious experience and the physical world.  
</p>
<u><h2>My General Summary</h2></u>
<p>Generally speaking, Anil Seth’s YouTube videos strongly reflect his deep knowledge and extensive research on the mystery of consciousness. Through his countless digital media productions and appearances, it is evident that he has a great interest in sharing his work findings online with the general public so they can also have a deeper understanding of what it truly means to be a human being with a conscious experience. Seth’s YouTube videos are often short and straight to the point, which has allowed many of his videos to go “viral” and spark interest in those who view his content; leading to further meaningful conversations and discussions on his topics.<br>
<br>
Regarding his viewpoints, I think Anil Seth is making a great contribution to solving the scientific mystery of consciousness. Throughout his videos, he often expresses his well-known theory that perception is generated by the brain in its efforts to perceive sensory input coming from outside of the body. He believes that the mind is dependent on the body, and vice versa, continuously arguing that our conscious experiences are merely controlled hallucinations generated by the brain’s mechanisms when it predicts and perceives the causes sensory input. Not only is he doing his own work and research in the field of consciousness, but he is also raising awareness to the topic and inspiring others to do their own research and further discuss in the comment sections of his videos. <br>
<br>
Overall, Anil Seth is a highly-educated, reliable source that the general public can use to easily further their knowledge on broad and complex topics such as consciousness, philosophy, and neuroscience. I think that he is a very successful Digitial Cognitive Scientist that I, as well as many others, will continue to watch and learn from.
