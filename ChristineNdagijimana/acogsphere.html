    <div id="output2">This interview with Jordan Peterson was conducted by Russel Brand on his independent media platform. A lot of things were discussed in this interview, some topics that would even require a separate video to thoroughly tackle them. Nonetheless, Peterson and Brand did a good job of covering necessary points and evoking deeper thought and interest on some there points. Topics they covered included the current culture wars, identity politics, censorship, and a bit of religion and theology.</div>
