        Jordan Peterson is a Canadian Psychologist and author. He is 61 years old and married to Tammy Roberts. Together they have 2 children, Mikhaila Peterson and Julia Peterson. In recent years, Peterson has gained a large following on his social media and is particularly popular in the Instagram and YouTube space. He does not shy away from talking about controversial topics that are relevant to today and tries his best to foster a space of open dialogue and critical thinking among his followers, especially on political and religious discourse. He has taught at many prestigious universities and has conducted lecture tours speaking to crowds of thousands of people. He currently is finishing up his Peterson Academy project to drive down the cost of a bachelor's degree while offering better quality education.

        Interview Summary
    </div>

    <p id="interview-summary">
        This interview with Jordan Peterson was conducted by Russel Brand on his independent media platform. A lot of things were discussed in this interview, some topics that would even require a separate video to thoroughly tackle them. Nonetheless, Peterson and Brand did a good job of covering necessary points and evoking deeper thought and interest on some there points. Topics they covered included the current culture wars, identity politics, censorship, and a bit of religion and theology.
    </p>

    <p id="interview-paragraph">
        The first portion of the interview covered the danger of the online world today and how it is not an accurate perception of the real world. The conversation was prompted by Brand’s question asking whether Peterson thinks that what we’re striving for as people is a morality/set of principles that is transcendent of the current cultural divisions that appear to be defining our time, and if we need to find something akin to universalism to reorganize and reorient our cultural conversation. Or whether it’s not possible to establish systems of governance and consensus today due to the fragmentation and divisiveness of our culture. Peterson believes that there is a push for unity in our culture today but it’s being done by people who are fear-mongering with the apocalypse. He believes that unity is being compelled with terror. The two discuss how the media today is giving us a false sense of reality and has been highly gameable by narcissists and psychopaths. Peterson and Brand both agree that instead of creating unity, the media has been used to engineer and amplify division. I also agree with this and believe that the events of the last three years have been a testament to this truth.

    <p id="interview-paragraph">
        As the interview continues, Peterson frequently uses the Biblical corpus to better explain his thoughts and ideas. A large theme that is continuously brought up is the archetype of the hostile brothers (specifically Cain and Able). Peterson states the notion that there’s a battle on the spiritual level between the spirit of Cain and the Spirit of Able. The spirit of Cain is resentful, murderous, and eventually genocidal. Peterson believes that there’s always been a battle between these two modes of existence. He touches on how this battle is portrayed in plenty of pop-culture tropes, such as Thor and Loki, Batman and the Joker, Superman and Lex-Luther, etc. Every superhero has his villain. I found his discourse on this interesting because although as a Christian I’ve had this understanding of there being a battle between good and evil within people, I’ve never really thought about how common this theme runs through society, even so-called secular spaces. The notion of this underlying archetype that is a force within the world comes back later in the interview where Peterson goes into his belief that as humans we see the world as a story and that this is scientifically backed up. He states that this is a notion that even Richard Dawkins should have as it is supported by Darwinian evolution. I think this was the most interesting part of the interview as this notion of the human seeing the world through a story and that being a key part of reality is not something new to me. It was cool to hear how it’s not just experientially backed up but scientifically as well.

     <p id="interview-paragraph">
        The important takeaway from this interview was that uncensored, critical discourse is important. In a day where censorship is high, independent media is key to making sure that truth stays out there. Although there is a lot of uncontrollable, perverted, and “Cain” spirited messaging that has come up in the rise of this technological age, Peterson believes that it is important we continue to have open dialogue, combating the lies spread by the narcissists and psychopaths in power. He believes education plays a key role in this and towards the end of the interview promotes his upcoming Peterson Academy he’s starting, where he’ll offer a bachelor's degree 95% lower than the cost it is today with better quality. Overall, it was a really insightful and enjoyable interview that I would watch again.

        <strong>Psychology, Sexuality, and the AI Revolution - Jordan Peterson on the Larry Arnn Show:</strong> In this interview, Jordan Peterson is being interviewed by Larry Arnn. He covers a range of topics in this interview including, the modern identity crisis, Jungian psychology, and the AI revolution. I find his discourse on the AI revolution most relevant to our course topic. Peterson does not completely discredit the role AI has had in today’s society. He recognizes that, if used wisely, the AI revolution can and has added a lot of benefits to our society. However, he thinks that it has just as much the potential to ruin our society. He states his fundamental concern is that we’ll automate a super-intelligent tyranny. He also fears that if students continue to rely so heavily on artificial intelligence to do their work they’ll become cripple, unable to think for themselves. This reminds me of the week 12 discussion on how, although AI has been serving human life, it’s also brought challenges and problems that have led some to consider the AI revolution to be an existential threat. As the week 12 lecture content states, AI has become the most powerful part of digital technology and is not only useful in cognitive science research but is now a main player in digital humanities. However, I share Peterson’s concern for AI’s use in the education sphere. Students have begun to rely on AI as a crutch and I can see how this may result in the decline of creativity and critical thought in our generation. Although I think we should take advantage of AI as an aid in education, I think there should be protocols put in place to control its use. Unfortunately, I’m not sure how we’ll be able to do this.

        <strong>Doctor Jordan Peterson: The NUMBER ONE Reason for Divorce, Depression & Dark Thoughts! -</strong> This was a very insightful conversation that Jordan Peterson had on the Diary of a CEO podcast. A large focus of this interview was how to better one's marriage and manage conflict. Peterson offered a lot of advice on how to deal with conflict in your relationship productively, stating that listening is the most helpful thing you can do within your relationship. This discourse on relationships reminded me of our week 8 lecture content. In week 8 we discussed how children go from being self-centered to other-centered as they grow. They begin to recognize faces and later develop a theory of mind. These abilities are crucial to social interactions. Learning how to navigate through social interactions is something that children continue to learn through adolescence and even into adulthood. This discussion was interesting because, although we’ve developed new methods for modern communication, such as smartphones and social media, we still struggle within our interpersonal relationships to properly communicate. Peterson’s advice was pretty simple however, it’s something that we struggle a lot with in our interpersonal relationships. Listening. You would think these modern ways of communication would have helped us connect more but maybe, this digital age has contributed to our inability to properly do so, since a lot of our communication these days is done through a screen. Dating is now done online and some people spend months, even years, before they meet their significant other in person, let alone live with them. I can imagine how different communication looks like for such a couple looks like. A lot of friendships these days are also being made online. I think the digital age has made forming relationships easier in the sense that we can branch out and reach people across the globe, but I wonder how it’s affected our ability to communicate with each other within our relationships and manage conflict.
