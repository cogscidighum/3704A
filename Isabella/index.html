<p style="color:#395B95;font:monaco, 14px; text-align:left;"> Video Summary </p>

<p style="color:#08214C;font-family: arial, 14px; text-align:Left;">Since 1996, Marvin Chun has been invited to speak over 150 times at various universities, forums, and conferences. In August of 2018, he gave a very interesting presentation at TEDxKFAS in Seoul, South Korea. His TedTalk is titled “Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence Need Each Other”. This presentation explained how advancements in neuroscience rely on advancements in artificial intelligence, and vice-versa.</p>

    </div>
    
<p style="color:#08214C;font-family: arial, 14px; text-align:Left;">He begins the presentation by mentioning how we live in a very exciting time, fields like artificial intelligence and neuroscience are making amazing breakthroughs that could benefit our day-to-day lives.</p>

<p style="color:#08214C;font-family: arial, 14px; text-align:Left;">He explains that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the major tools he uses in his research of cognitive behavior. MRI is a powerful and non-invasive imaging technique that uses computer-generated radio waves and a magnetic field to measure a subject's brain activity. He also explained that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an imaging tool that allows us to infer neural activity. He relates these tools to telescopes or microscopes as they allow us to see and learn more about the brain.</p> 

<p style="color:#08214C;font-family: arial, 14px; text-align:Left;">Chun gave the example of Jack Gallant's Lab at the University of Berkeley to show how artificial intelligence has given scientists the ability to learn more about a subject’s neural activity. In Gallant’s lab, researchers are interested in the relationship between neural activity and watching a movie during an fMRI procedure. When a participant is in the fMRI machine, they see a movie playing on the left and on the right, there is an artificial learning machine that analyzes what they are looking at (2011)</p>

  <p style="color:#08214C;font-family: arial, 14px; text-align:Left;">This study inspired two researchers in Marvin’s Yale University Lab. Alan Cohen and Bryce Cool were interested to see if they could draw models of the faces that participants looked at. Though it was only about 65% accurate, the computer was able to draw what it thought the face looked like based on the brain activity collected through fMRI.</p> 



<p style="color:#08214C;font-family: arial, 14px; text-align:Left;">Marvin then introduced another study that was conducted at Yale University by Todd Constable and his research team. They are  using a fMRI machine and asking the patients to simply lay down and relax. Then they analyze their brain activity and create a spreadsheet of numbers. They found that each individual has a different set of numbers which measure how parts of our brains communicate with each other. Since these numbers are unique to each individual, they call them ‘brain fingerprints”. They also found a correlation between certain characteristics or behaviors and certain components of a person’s brain fingerprint. With this, they are also able to use fMRI technology to compute a participant's IQ level. They can quantify things such as a participants severity of ADHD symptoms or an Alzhiemer’s patients memory loss. </p>

<p style="color:#08214C;font-family: arial, 14px; text-align:Left;"> While these findings are very exciting, Chun mentions that we must thank the advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence. He continues by offering more examples of how advancements in artificial intelligences have benefited our daily lives in many different ways. Some of these advancements include product recommendation algorithms, self-driving cars, and image recognition algorithms. </p>

<p style="color:#08214C;font-family: monaco, monospace; text-align:center;"> He also mentions that because of recent advances in artificial intelligence and neuroscience, it is now possible for a machine algorithm to beat human champions in the very complex game of AlphaGo. Previously, even the fastest and most powerful supercomputers were unable to beat champion players because they failed to explore every possible move. Demis Hassabis is the co-founder and CEO of the artificial intelligence company, DeepMind. This company incorporated neuroscience to improve the computer algorithms which gave the computer the ability to beat humans. </p>

<p style="color:#08214C;font-family: arial, 14px; text-align:Left;"> Marvin Chun is very grateful for DeepMind’s innovation and appreciates how Demis Hassabis emphasizes the importance of the marriage between cognitive science, neuroscience, and AI. In his 2017 paper, Hassabis argues, 
 </p>

<p style="color:#08214C;font-family: monaco, monospace; text-align:center;"> “Better understanding of biological brains could play a vital role in building intelligent machines. We survey historical interactions between the AI and neuroscience fields and emphasize current advances in AI that have been inspired by the study of neural computation in humans and other animals. We conclude by highlighting shared themes that may be key for advancing future research in both fields”.  (Hassabis et al, 2017) </p>

<p style="color:#08214C;font-family: arial, 14px; text-align:Left;"> Marvin believes that while cognitive science, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence share a joint mission, there are some considerations that should be made. He states that computers have more power and speed compared to humans. Computers excel in replay because they don’t need to sleep or eat like humans do. 
 </p>

<p style="color:#08214C;font-family: arial, 14px; text-align:Left;">However, humans are more adaptable and versatile so we can transfer learning much better. For example, we don’t need to be trained on very specific tasks or use training models like computers do. When humans learn something, they are often able to apply their knowledge in other areas. </p>

<p style="color:#08214C;font-family: arial, 14px; text-align:Left;"> Computers also excel in processing large quantities of data. However, they don’t know what to do with that data unless further instructed. They will always need a programmer or human teacher, unlike a human who can learn things themselves based on passed experience. Marvin gives examples of instances where chatbots were learning from users on Twitter who taught them unethical things.  </p>

<p style="color:#08214C;font-family: arial, 14px; text-align:Left;"> Finally, he states that AI alone has ethical considerations that need to be addressed such as self-driving cars. Neuroscience also needs to consider things like screening peoples brains without their knowledge. We need to ensure that neuroscience and AI alike, take the proper moral and ethical precautions necessary before advancing further. </p>

<p style="color:#395B95;font:monaco, 14px; text-align:left;"> My Opinion </p>

<p style="color:#08214C;font-family: arial, 14px; text-align:Left;"> I believe that Marvin Chun's TED Talk offers a compelling and thought-provoking perspective on the symbiotic relationship between neuroscience and artificial intelligence. His argument that neuroscience and AI can mutually benefit from each other is well-founded and resonates with the advancements and possibilities in these fields. </p>

<p style="color:#08214C;font-family: arial, 14px; text-align:Left;"> Chun makes a strong case for the potential applications of fMRI and AI in understanding and predicting human behavior. The successful collaboration between neuroscience and AI in the creation of AlphaGo further underscores the potential for groundbreaking discoveries. </p>

<p style="color:#08214C;font-family: arial, 14px; text-align:Left;"> I appreciate his emphasis on ethical considerations and mental privacy which is essential in the age of rapidly evolving technology. Recognizing the need for responsible use of these technologies is a crucial point and a reminder of the ethical challenges that come with AI advancements. </p>

<p style="color:#08214C;font-family: arial, 14px; text-align:Left;"> I agree with Chun's argument that the integration of neuroscience and AI holds immense promise for personalized predictions and advancements in various fields, including medicine and education. It is a compelling vision of a future where human cognition and AI algorithms complement each other. </p>
