<p style="color:black;font-family: monaco, 24 px; text-align:center;"> In this brief  interview on the Yale Daily News YouTube channel, Marvin Chun introduces himself and his academic background. He discusses why he wanted to become the dean of Yale University, the challenges associated with it, and the initiatives he is planning. The interview concludes with Marvin mentioning his aspirations for the institution. </p1>

<p style="color:black;font-family: monaco, 24 px; text-align:center;"> Marvin begins this Ted Talk by asking the audience, “How many of you would like to be more productive?” He mentions that productivity and focus is a big challenge that most of us face. Marvin states that we’re privileged to live in an age that has technology at our fingertips however, this can lead to information overload and distraction. To illustrate the brain's limited capacity to process information, he conducts attention tests like the famous video of passing basketballs. In this video, viewers are asked to count how many passes the white team makes. Since they are so focused on the white team, viewers fail to notice a bear dancing in the background. </p1>
    
  <h1 style="color:#395B95;font:monaco, 26 px; text-align:center;"> This Is An Awareness Test </h1>

<p style="color:black;font-family: monaco, 24 px; text-align:center;"> He then introduces a study that he worked on where the researchers use MRI to track the brain activity of participants. They are tasked to focus on a number of items and the researchers compared the brain effects of focusing on 1,2, or 3 items. The results demonstrated how our brain can easily focus on one item, but multiple items require more brain work. 

Marvin leaves the audience with 3 tips to improve attention and focus: 
simplify information, Relax, Unitask. </p1>

 <p style="color:black;font-family: monaco, 24 px; text-align:center;"> In this video, Marvin Chun discusses advancements in neuroscience, particularly the ability to decode and read minds using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). He introduces studies that go beyond basic brain mapping, he shows how fMRI can be used to read people's thoughts. In a study that he worked on, participants imagined scenes/faces, and their brain activity could be decoded to show what they were thinking. The video further introduced the progress made in using fMRI to read minds, he talks about the potential applications and ethical considerations associated with this evolving technology. </p1>

  <p style="color:black;font-family: monaco, 24 px; text-align:center;"> This video featuring Marvin Chun focuses on the integration of brain imaging, artificial intelligence, and cognitive neuroscience. He discusses the potential applications of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in decoding thoughts and measuring cognitive states associated with anxiety, depression, dementia, autism. He talks about how the collaboration between neuroscience and AI is very beneficial. As mentioned in other videos, DeepMind is a perfect example of this.  </p1>


  <h1 style="color:#395B95;font:monaco, 26 px; text-align:center;"> CTL Forum: How Faculty are Using Digital Technology to Meet Pedagogical Goals, Welcome and Keynote </h1>
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NGaka62y5R8?si=4OUO4lTfkHYx5duY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <p style="color:black;font-family: monaco, 24 px; text-align:center;"> This video is of a panel by CLT who hosted a 2017 forum regarding the faculties use of technology. The panel’s speakers included Scott Strobel, Henry Ford, Deputy Provost,  and the Keynote talk was given by Dr. Marvin Chun. In his speech, Chun discusses his experiences in teaching and the implementation of technology. His first example was clickers for each student to hold during class. They allow students to answer polls or questions anonymously and quickly. He also mentioned Piazza which is a student message forum that allows people to communicate more effectively. He talks about the online programs that the university is implementing to help bridge the gap for incoming students. Without the advancement of technology, we would not be able to have clickers, social forums, or online classes. </p1>

   <p style="color:black;font-family: monaco, 24 px; text-align:center;"> This is an advertisement for an event which was held in 2014. It was a panel on sports psychology included; Avram Grant ( one of Europe's most prominent soccer coaches), Keith Allain (Yale Men's Hockey team's Coach/ 2x Olympic coach), and Marvin Chun. They discussed questions such as, “How do you mentally prepare for competition at the highest level?” While we are unable to view the full discussion, this still demonstrates Marvin Chuns versatility in the fields of cognitive neuroscience, psychology, and artificial intelligence. While his current interests mainly focus on the implementation of fMRI, he is well equipped to discuss many cognitive science topics. </p1>
