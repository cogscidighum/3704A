        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Biidaaban is an Anishinaabe word that embodies the concept of time as a fluid entity, where the past, present, and future converge into a singular living moment. For the traditional people who personify this word, it represents the power of now; the value in awareness; the singularity of presence. Indeed, to experience biidaaban is to experience a figurative blackhole. The experience of such traditional insight is not limited to the Anishinaabe or first nations people but is represented across time and cultures throughout the world. We know the experience of it as being mindful, and the understanding of such to be enlightenment.</p>


        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Ryan Holiday is a contemporary writer and philosopher who has gained prominence for his work on Stoicism and its application in modern life. He is a pivotal figure in the resurgence of ancient philosophy, making it accessible and relevant through digital media and modern narratives, such as through his podcast “The Daily Stoic.” The episode “Sam Harris on Stoicism and Mindfulness Practice” covers the interplay between Eastern and Western philosophies, the role of mindfulness and meditation in achieving a stoic mindset, and the applicability of these ancient practices in the modern world. Sam Harris is a renowned philosopher, neuroscientist, and author whose work intersects cognitive science, ethics, and rationality, with a particular focus on consciousness. 
        The dynamics between these two prominent thought-provoking leaders is profound and insightful. The focus of my review will be on one section that resonated deeply with me where the act of intricacies of embodying enlightenment through mindfulness is broken down. </p>


        <h2>Critical Review</h2>
        <p>Sam Harris says the highest form of wisdom comes from recognizing “…the intrinsic freedom of awareness in this moment, regardless of what is happening.” There are two parts to this comment that build on each other and are equally profound.</p> 
        
        <h3>Part One</h3>
        <p>Firstly, this elevated wisdom arises from recognizing and cherishing an inner freedom, a liberation that blooms from being fully present in the moment—mindfulness itself. This wisdom is enlightenment, with the intrinsic freedom being synonymous with a mindful state. This concept unfolded as Harris reflected on the nature of "peak" experiences—those profound moments accessed through psychedelics or deep meditation—and their contributions to mindfulness and enlightenment. He observed that while some strive to string together these peak moments in pursuit of a sustained mindfulness, the very nature of peaks implies an inevitable return to a baseline state. Harris acknowledges the transformative power of these experiences but emphasizes that their true value in cultivating mindfulness and enlightenment is minor compared to the essence of these states. For Harris, the crux of enlightenment resides in the everyday mindfulness, the commonplace state of presence. What is paramount is the wisdom we retain from these experiences, whether they stem from psychedelics, meditation, or entirely different realms.
        I resonate deeply with this perspective. Harris recognizes that while these experiences can be profound and beneficial, the genuine treasure for enlightenment is the insight that persists beyond them. This principle holds true across the spectrum of life's experiences—from the joyous to the trivial—each leaving us with more than we possessed before. Experiences, by their very nature, enrich us with context and insight, informing our journey forward, no matter how subtle their imprint may be. Without this enrichment, experiences would lose their intrinsic value.
        In mindfulness, we converge upon the present moment, seemingly detaching from past experiences. This appears contradictory, as if these experiences lose their significance in the mindful state, being outside the focus of the present. However, as Harris articulates, "[mindfulness] is a freedom not predicated on anything about experience." This is not a paradox; rather, it is a discernment between the experiences themselves and the enduring insights they provide. The former is a transient event; the latter, a compass that shapes our consciousness and informs our mindfulness, existing independently of the experiences that gave rise to it. In the act of mindfulness, it is this enduring wisdom—the essence of our past—that remains pertinent and accessible, not the fleeting experiences themselves.
        </p>

        <h3>Part Two</h3>
        <p>The second aspect of Harris's commentary emphasizes that the cultivation of wisdom through mindfulness is not contingent upon external circumstances. It speaks to the ability to maintain a mindful state irrespective of ongoing events, whether they are as commonplace as a disagreement with a spouse or as disruptive as a distressing email. Harris suggests that the essence of enlightenment—or the highest wisdom—is the capacity to anchor oneself in the moment, to remain mindful amidst life's turbulence. He posits that true mindfulness, and thus intrinsic freedom, is achieved by detaching from these immediate experiences. According to Harris, such freedom is realized even before the physiological responses to these events have subsided.
        I agree that this detachment from immediate experiences is a critical component of mindfulness and the path to enlightenment. It leads to the realization that the emotional charge, timing, or any other characteristic of an encounter is inconsequential to the practice of mindfulness. Indeed, while it may be more challenging to find tranquility after a stressful email than after a session of yoga, the refuge provided by mindfulness remains constant across all situations. Similarly, whether an emotional experience is fresh or hours old, its impact is neutralized in the state of mindfulness. Echoing the first point, the significance of these experiences fades in the act of being mindful, leaving only the wisdom gleaned from them to inform our present awareness.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In the pursuit of mindfulness, we learn to appreciate that our experiences, while formative, do not dictate our ability to be present or mindful. This realization is the gateway to the highest form of wisdom: enlightenment. Such principles resonate deeply with the Stoic teachings that Ryan Holiday brings to the contemporary forefront, aligning harmoniously with the insightful dialogue prompted by Sam Harris. My core message from this critical review is clear: Mindfulness is our inherent possession, impervious to external influences, offering a steadfast refuge across the spectrum of human emotion. It is akin to biidaaban, a concept that sees time not as a linear progression but as a singular moment of existence. Rather than a black hole, the practice of mindfulness is, in fact, a wellspring of light and opportunity. This journey, while profound, is not beyond our reach; it is an innate path available to us all, inviting not trepidation but rather the embrace of its illuminating presence. The agency to pursue mindfulness and enlightenment is entirely our own, and in this realization, we find not a daunting abyss but a luminous horizon.</p>
