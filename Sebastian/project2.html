    <h2>Intro</h2>
     <p>Tom Scott is a very popular Youtuber, with it being his primary source of income, and his success described with 6.21 million subscribers, 729 videos, and almost 2 billion views (Socialblade. 2013). He started his channel in 2006, with cooking skits, and eventually just skits about anything. In 2013, he transitioned into linguistics content - his field, and after gaining some popularity off of those, he started a series called Things you might not know, where he shared things he learnt and found interesting. Eventually he started intercuting linguistics content uploads with the series, and started another series called Amazing Places, where he visited locations he found cool. With the advent of YouTube series, he started a game showcalled Game on  with a series of games demonstrating mathematical concepts, and a podcast called Citation Needed quizzing on Wikipedia knowledge. As his channel grew, he ended up removing the series titles to his videos, which was a reasonable decision with all his content being rather consistently viewed by the same audience. Tom gained significant and consistent popularity, with his videos being well researched, and relevant across time, he is aware of his power with 6 million subscribers, and seeks to make his channel informative and entertaining, a goal he achieves after 17 years of experience in content creation, and values of truth, and curiosity.

    <h2>Analysis</h2>
   <p>Tom’s education is in linguistics, at York University. His channel started off with linguistics content, discussing linguistic phenomena he found interesting. These videos attempt to appeal to a general audience, explaining everything that non-linguists might not know, and talking about things that anyone may wonder. With titles such as “Fantastic features we don’t have in the English language” and “All the colours, including Grue: How languages see colours differently”, and Tom’s welcoming attitude, you can see that these videos intend to get more people interested in the field of linguistics, relating it to other topics such as psychology or anthropology and with short durations (the longest being 4 minutes). This method of appeal appears successful, as those videos grew his popularity, and still get views to this day, despite being 10 years old. 

	Tom Scott’s Things you might not know series started in 2014, entirely replacing the linguistics content at its inception. These videos copy the short format of his linuguistics concept, but cover a much broader range of topics. Videos include “Why aren’t there more helicopter crashes in London?”,  “What’s the longest word in the English language”, “Why do flag emoji count as two characters”, “How to make something one atom thick”, and “Why you should write down your goals”. In his talk on AI and truth, Tom brings up the way YouTubers often gain popularity as they throw stuff at their channel, till something gets popular, then they repeat similar content. Tom’s Things you might not know series is a strange example of this idea. There is so much variety in this content, from things people might generally wonder, to questions people haven’t thought of, to strange solutions to extravagant problems. He appears to just be throwing out whatever he finds interesting, but doesn’t necessarily just repeat themes he’s seen successful, rather he copies his presentation, optimizing his own acting to what gained positive feedback, opposed to his content. This series is what shaped his channel today, investigating concepts that he finds fascinating, and holding onto hope that they might appeal to others. 

	As Tom gained more popularity, he sought to improve his channel, increasing the relevance of his research by inserting himself into relevant places in his Amazing Places series. Here, with such titles as “The not-quite-robots that help fix fusion reactors” and “Driving through Russia without a visa: The Saatse Boot”, Scott placed himself in unique environments (when possible) to explore how they work. This involved interviewing people who worked in such places, and taking a more journalistic approach to his videos. Tom Very much preferred this research approach as it appears to take over his channel to this day. 

	There was a period where Tom got into collaborating with other creators, running two different series on his channel for this purpose: Citation Needed is a quiz show where he tests others on random Wikipedia articles, and Game On looks at different mathematical concepts using games. The latter series isn’t the most popular, and because of such, he only ran it for 1 season, Citation Needed however evolved into a multi-season series, growing into more of a podcast format. These videos are interesting as they provide a more personal presentation of Tom. These videos still cover a range of different topics, which is what brings in Tom’s audience, but the lack of purpose to educate with them means that Tom can drop his teacher act, and express more of his personality. In his talk on AI and truth, he spoke about parasocial relationships, and how viewers start to form a one-side relationship with creators, as they grow fond of their personalities. These videos of Tom’s are definitely the easiest to form an opinion of Tom as a person on, he isn’t acting as an educator, or a journalist, rather he is just having fun with some friends. Tom kept up with his regular things you didn’t know and amazing places series for those more in the channel to learn new things, although, the format of citation needed still fulfilled his audiences desire to learn cool random things. 

	The modern era of Tom Scott videos drops the series titles, with everything of his fitting the same vibe of things that might be interesting. The majority of his videos are like hit Amazing Places series, as he visits place such as . There is still content of him just sharing cool facts like in his video “Why the US Army electrifies this water” where visits the Chicago and Sanitary ship canal, an electric gate used to keep carp out. Occasionally he even releases a linguistics video in the style of his original content. With these videos, he pursues a journalistic method, seeking out people with experience in the topics he discusses. His videos these days regularly get millions of views, and still don’t consistently cover one specific field. 

	Tom’s channel is something of a novelty, an educational channel with millions of subscribers picked up by talking about things all over the place. Considering that the YouTube algorithm works believing there is some consistency between content, he demonstrates that this isn’t necessary, with his audience appealing to such variety. Furthermore, he is aware of his privilege with such a large audience accepting whatever he puts out, and the power that grants him. He still seeks a profit, using clickbaity titles and thumbnails, which might drawn in those not familiar with him, but does not slack in the quality of his videos, often travelling on location, giving his videos a very documentary vibe.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Tom Scott seems to enjoy his status as a celebrity scientist, he enthusiastically continues to make videos as his job, only just taking a hiatus after 10 years of content. He uses his audience to get him into all sorts of places, and share all the interesting things about them. With this, and the journalistic approach his channel evolved into, it’s become more of a platform to amplify others, discussing their interesting jobs. It’s rather strange the channel took this direction, starting off with skits cooking things in strange ways, and then talking about linguistics. Considering Tom is a linguist, the effort he puts in to his non-linguistics videos, having more experienced voices share, showing Scott’s values truth and accuracy in his content. 
Considering his talk on algorithms and truth it was a brave move to critique what led to his success. Tom made the most out of the YouTube algorithm, repeating what he saw succeed, but still figuring out how to have variety in his channel. When he saw success, he tried not to take advantage of his position, and continued to stay factual and well researched. His personality is one of the most attractive parts of his videos, even when they’re focusing on others talking about what they do for a living, the general tone of his content makes it an enjoyable watch whatever he is talking about. He acknowledges that he is a celebrity, and he builds up parasocial relationships around his personality, but tries not to take advantage of this. He acknowledges his audience and uses it to share interesting stories of others. His channel remains quite consistent, if not just enjoyable, for his presentation and attitude.
