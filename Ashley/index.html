  <blockquote>
  Poppy Crum is an adjunct professor at Standford University and focuses on the impact of new technological developments on the neuroplasticity of the brain and learning. She is also a neuroscientist and technologist who works with top companies and organizations, such as Dolby, to develop empathetic technologies that change their business processes. Her goal is to build technologies that best enhance our experiences and how we interact with the world. She has a master's degree in experimental psychology and cognitive science at McGill University, and her PhD in neuroscience and psychophysics at UC Berkeley.

  <h2 style="color:green;text-align:center;"> Summary </h2>
  <p> Neuroscientist Poppy Crum discusses how she thinks we can be more human if we can accept more than one reality, meaning that everyone perceives their own in their existence. She explains how people aren’t good at accepting that we experience the physical world differently and how everyone’s sensory experience is solely based on probabilities. To prove her point, she explains the infamous ‘dress illusion’ in 2015, which is an illusion that led to people seeing two completely different dress colours due to lighting (Image 1), led to people debating online not being able to accept opposing perceptions of the dress that wasn’t their own. We understand that we all have different lives as we have different environments, however, there is a lack of perceptual empathy among each other. Crum references her personal life as being a violinist, which makes her prone to understand auditory sensations within their musical pitches. She also talked about how developing blind spots due to migraines helped her understand and empathize with her mother who struggled with her vision. It made her realize that you never understand a person until you consider things from their point of view. Her second point is regarding facial dysmorphia, which is a condition where one cannot see faces naturally. Francis Bacon is a painter known for drawing distorted faces, however, he has facial dysmorphia, so he was painting how he saw faces. His perspective on the world is considered abstract art to most people. There is a power to seeing both sides; understanding that your perspective and someone else’s is completely different. She refers to what she calls the human problem, which is that we don’t know the state of each other’s biology & its changes. Our individual environments affect our neural sensitivities. Her team had developed sensory gloves that creates the feeling of the hands of people with arthritis in order for them to understand how it feels to create with someone else’s hands. They gave designers these gloves and it led to them creating designs that benefitted people with arthritis in mind. This proves her final point that it is important to be vulnerable with each other for empathy between people.

  <h2 style="font-family:arial;text-align:center;"> The debate regarding empathy </h2>
  <p>In my opinion, I can agree with Poppy Crum regarding her feelings toward empathy and seeing the world in a different perception than our own. If we only focus on how we perceive the world and ourselves, it limits our worldview and prevents us from feeling and helping other people, especially if it’s a large group of people. I agree with her that we are all different neurologically and we all experience the same perceptions differently, hence why it is important to be empathetic towards others. However seeing as Crum is a neurologist, her take on empathy is very neurologically based which I don’t fully see as fully in our genetics and neurons. I rather see the neurons set the baseline of empathy, yet it slowly gets developed through social interactions and life experiences. There is a debate regarding whether empathy is innate or learned. To argue that it is innate, empathy lets humans perceive others' suffering & helps us understand and feel their pain, which is beneficial for mutual aid which is dependent on survival (Riess, 2017). Additionally, the inner intimidation theory argues that there is a neural relay mechanism that lets individuals exhibit unconscious mimicry of the mannerisms & facial expressions of others (Riess, 2017). The neural relay mechanism refers to the systems of mirror neurons, which are neurons that will fire both when an individual performs a certain action, and when they observe that action being performed by someone else (Acharya & Shukla, 2012). Mirror neurons are developed before the age of infancy, which helps them understand the actions of others (Acharya & Shukla, 2012). Additionally, studies show that people who are more empathetic have stronger activation in mirror neurons for emotions (Acharya & Shukla, 2012). Neural networks let us perceive emotions & relate to them emotionally and cognitively. On the other side, empathy could also be seen as a trait that is learned through our interactions with society. Empathy is seen as an automatic process that notices the feelings of others, which can be developed through social interactions (Heyes, 2018). The learned matching hypothesis is that the automatic activation of empathy depends on a set of learned associations, which is connected through the experience of a certain emotion while observing the same emotion shown by someone else (Heyes, 2018). As we grow and interact with the world, we develop associations with a multitude of things, emotions and actions that help us develop our empathy. There is a multitude of research showing that social interactions help develop our empathic skills. Research shows that children of depressed mothers experience less neuron mirroring and are less empathic compared to the children of non-depressed mothers (Heyes, 2018). This explains how our empathic skills are developing through our social environment, and parental figures are the first view into social life. In addition, newborns start to cry when they hear the sound of crying, which according to learned matching is due to how hearing their own tears has made them implicitly react to hearing cries by crying themselves (Heyes, 2018). Culturally, children are raised in collectivist cultures, which are cultures where families grow close and loyal bonds, they tend to have higher emotional cognition and empathic concerns (Heyes, 2018). To summarize Poppy Crum’s TED talk about the importance of perceptions regarding empathy adds to the neurological discussion of empathy. However, empathy is also seen as a trait that is socially developed.
