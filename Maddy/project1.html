        <h1>Abstract</h1>
        <p>Jordan Peterson talks about how your memory impacts how you make decisions in your life with a few examples. He declares that the purpose of your memory is to “provide a map for navigating life”, meaning that the memories you form are used to aid you in reacting to events in your life.</p>
He states that you need to have some form of malevolence in your life at an early age to learn how to deal with the good and bad respectively with a level of independence, and if you cannot receive that then you will face the consequences as time passes.
His main example is bullying, and how it can manifest itself with rage over time and progress into murderous fantasies (from a client of his).
His ideology to prevent this in the future, as well as to limit this in current individuals is to self-reflect on how you may have played a part in bad moments and memories in your life, and that all these moments are useful to learn from and make better decisions in your next encounter. Peterson also takes the stance on being assertive in your negative environments early on to prevent the snowball effect of being bullied and other traumatic events that become repetitive in your psyche.</p>
Overall, he states that you need to build a level of immunity and confidence in yourself, so you are prepared for negative events that are inevitable in life, and you need to gain an understanding of your past to learn how to better respond in the future.</p>

    <h2 class="margin" id="Paragraph">Jordan Peterson And Memories - Encoding</h2>
    <p>
      Jordan Peterson is an infamous name when it comes to the distribution of scientific knowledge in the digital age of the world. A blessing and a curse it is to have such vast knowledge at the touch of a button, but it comes with its flaws. In this video, Peterson describes his empirical research with memory and how past life events can impact your life quality (Peterson, 2023). He uses his example of a patient he encountered. This individual faced the hands of bullying and experienced a large amount of trauma that followed him years into the future. Peterson takes the stance that although unpleasant to deal with, negative events in life, such as bullying, are necessary for cognitive development and the development of proper emotional regulation and the importance of your memory in relation to so. 
      <br><br>
      
      His analogy is from a patient who suffered from intense negative emotions surrounding being bullied in his high school years. This individual had such horrific experiences that he would continue to get psychiatric help from Dr. Peterson on this issue. Peterson used this to explain how you need negativity in life to learn from the experience and grow independently. He claims that when you are a child, the experience of experiencing negative events in life teaches you the dichotomy or so-called “truth" of living, and how you must face those events with a level of confidence as well as responsibility that you are the one who needs to navigate out of these situations. The same is to say about positive events in life. He then hypothesizes that the reason why this individual has been having such issues is from the lack of exposure in childhood, and from the lack of exposure comes a lack of past knowledge that you can use for current experiences. This ideology is confirmed by modern cognitive science, which is known as predictive processing. You use your past experiences and knowledge to aid you in understanding and navigating future experiences.</p>
  <br>
  Interestingly, Peterson's ideology also introduces an aspect of self-reflection in the process. In this example, he brings up how perhaps the individual who was being bullied played a part in the event. He claims that having a level of introspection is key to being a more self-aware person, and to being able to commit to fully using a past event to make your future a more fulfilling one, with less dwelling on the past. Peterson remarks on the fact that confidence is necessary to complete these tasks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Along with this, Peterson makes a claim that dwelling on past trauma is not helpful in the slightest, and an issue that a lot of people are facing in current society is doing so in a way that makes them feel “trapped” and lack confidence. 
This way of thinking about knowledge representation of the world can be compared to the interactive activation model of cognition in the sense that your childhood and “starting information” forms the basis of how your knowledge is represented in your mind. Thus, if you have more exposure to negative experiences then they will be encoded on a deeper level in your mind and will have more connections throughout your brain as compared to a highly inactive one. 
<br>
  <br>
  Although some aspects of this talk seem appealing at first glance, it seems to be based on a focus to bring your interest towards what he is saying, and a lack of scientific explanation on Petersons' side, which could help convey his ideas as facts and not simply a “talk”, or YouTube video. In terms of using memories as a blueprint to navigate life, this is proven by what is known as predictive processing in cognitive science. This uses the Bayes model that states that humans use current sensory input of the environment as well as prior knowledge to fully comprehend their surroundings (Newen et al., 2018). This is a cycle where you can use your past knowledge to apply it to current events, and then store current events in your memory to use it in future events. This supposes that humans want to use their brain power in the most efficient way possible, as well as minimize errors in comprehending their surroundings. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Given this, Petersons claim that you need to experience negative events to maintain this prior knowledge of how to understand and navigate life does indeed make sense, as the more you experience, the easier it will be for you to guide yourself with a deeper level of understanding in life. However, it is not clear the extent to which he claims it to be. By this, I mean to what extent is it helpful compared to harmful? As his example is, bullying is a broad category that can range from verbal to physical and psychological. So, although you may gain knowledge from experiencing some name-calling, there are no helpful aspects of facing physical or psychological damage in your formative years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The aspect of self-reflection is a positive aspect of this video that looking at an event from as many perspectives as possible contributes to overall happiness levels. This way of thinking about negative experiences in life can be useful for someone who experienced low-level negative events, but not for someone who is dealing with a large-scale traumatic event. In neuroscience it is evident that trauma changes your brain chemistry, and some individuals may even be diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (Yehuda et al., 2015) because of the trauma, they will not benefit from believing that they are responsible for what happened to them. Along with this, it is not in the best manner to say that people who suffer from these events need to “not dwell” on them. This is quite interesting, as he is a clinical psychologist and has studied the effects of these intensive mental disorders that are founded based on traumatic events in life, but still has a radical notion that you are responsible in some sense for those events. You should have been stronger and moved past it. This is not a permanent solution, as scientific information proves how important it is to understand that sometimes things happen to you that you are not responsible for and that you should not “forget” and move past these fully but use these events as lessons to develop your understanding of the world using the predictive processing framework more deeply. 
  <br>
  <br>
  An alternative I would suggest to his ideology of memories being used as a framework to navigate life is to condemn the idea that you are fully responsible for the events now, but how you use that prior knowledge is the more important skill that you can learn in your formative years. The responsibility one holds is that one must put your knowledge to use in a sense where they do uses memories to map out their life, from an evolutionary standpoint. In your formative years, you will be able to use the education given to you in schools, as well as personal experience to develop your schema about life, experiences, physical people, or places you should avoid and how you can maintain your physical and mental well-being for as long as possible.
  <br>
  While there are scientific studies proving that humans use the integration of memories to navigate through life (Newman et al., 2021), there is a lack of evidence supporting that exposure to negative events can be helpful in any way – it shows the opposite in fact. There is proof that repeated exposure to stressful events makes you more susceptible to diseases, such as the common cold (APA PsycNet, n.d.). So, although stressors are naturally occurring in life, it does not mean that you should not fully avoid them that you are able to. 
  <br>
  I would also revise this to include self-reflection as a component in the memory process as solely using memories to help you navigate life would not give you the optimal amount of support in a future unknown environment. My ideology differs from Peterson's because I do not believe you should reflect on yourself negatively. He implies that you need to critically evaluate the role that you played in the negative event, but taking a more positive approach is more helpful in a broader sense. There is evidence in cognitive neuroscience proving the importance of self-reflection and how beneficial it can be that it is the basis of many forms of therapy (Bennett-Levy & Lee, 2012), including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall, it is important to understand the dichotomy of information presented to you in YouTube videos regarding scientific content. Although Jordan Peterson provides a unique response to the modern age of trauma and memory storing as a form of learning, it is not to say that all the information and insights provided are based on facts. It is important to think critically about what is being said on social media. Peterson provides a beneficial account of predictive memory without naming it but uses a single and thorough example to provide real-world context to his ideologies. This is not the strongest argument as there are examples that can be used to disprove his ideas on how necessary negative events are in life, and how one must face trauma. Despite this blurry line with modern-age social media, there is also an ever-advancing scientific and peer-reviewed publications providing better insight to these serious topics.
