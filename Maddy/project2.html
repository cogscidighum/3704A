        <h2> Introduction</h2>
        <p>Jordan Peterson is a Professor at the University of Toronto. Many of his talks are clips from his lectures, which are typically from his Psychology classes. Outside of teaching, he also hosts talks on a range of platforms. The five most popular talks are examined in this page, ranging from critical thinking to social anxiety. Peterson has a blunt approach to the topics that he discusses, in which controversy arises. If you are interested in more information from the source, please look below for his website, as well as my previous page about Video 1.</p>
      <p>In the age of celebrity scientists, Jordan Peterson stands out. His popular videos are often found on social media platforms such as Youtube or Instagram and more often than not solicit advice that is supposedly backed up by psychological evidence. This is not uncommon in the twenty-first century, however, what Peterson provides for the world is different. He often gets many views with people either strongly agreeing or disagreeing to his content. In this page, we will be examining his most popular videos on Youtube to grasp his content and if they are a proper representation of psychology and cognitive science, as well as some criticisms on his views.</p>

        <h2>Video 1: This is how your memories affect your decision making</h2>
        <p>27:51 mins, 452,000 views. Jordan Peterson talks about how your memory impacts how you make decisions in your life with a few examples. He declares that the purpose of your memory is to “provide a map for navigating life”, meaning that the memories you form are used to aid you in reacting to events in your life.</p>
He states that you need to have some form of malevolence in your life at an early age to learn how to deal with the good and bad respectively with a level of independence, and if you cannot receive that then you will face the consequences as time passes.
His main example is bullying, and how it can manifest itself with rage over time and progress into murderous fantasies (from a client of his).
His ideology to prevent this in the future, as well as to limit this in current individuals is to self-reflect on how you may have played a part in bad moments and memories in your life, and that all these moments are useful to learn from and make better decisions in your next encounter. Peterson also takes the stance on being assertive in your negative environments early on to prevent the snowball effect of being bullied and other traumatic events that become repetitive in your psyche.</p>
Overall, he states that you need to build a level of immunity and confidence in yourself, so you are prepared for negative events that are inevitable in life, and you need to gain an understanding of your past to learn how to better respond in the future.</p>

        <h2>2: The best way to learn critical thinking</h2>
       
       
    
<p>4:01 mins, 1.9 m views. In this video, he claims that people oftentimes do not know how to be critical thinkers in their evironment because they do not know how to write properly and structure their arguments. He states that best way to teach people how to
  critically think is how to write. Because it is time-intensive. There is no difference between that and
  thinking. It helps you learn how to think to act effectively in the world. It helps you form your arguments coherently and you have influence in the world.</p>

        <h2>3: How to stop Procrastinating</h2>
        <p>11:09 mins, 2.4 m views. Conscientiousness: orderliness and industriousness.
  Working on micro habits, aims, and goals that you value. What are your sources of motivation in life? You can
  think of this from the big five personality traits. The microprocesses become rewarding because you know that
  you are moving forward towards your valued goal. You need to have a valued goal – the bigger, the better.
  Specify your long-term idea and where you want to stay away from (your fears in life). You need to consult the
  main goals in life and what you need to be happy. After creating the goal structure, you aim for it and use
  everything you learn to build yourself to be that person. You need to know when you fail because it teaches
  what you need to change for the future. A schedule is unbelievably useful for this. Set it up so you have the
  day you want every day (with responsibility along with it, you want to be better at the end of the day than
  you were in the beginning of the day). You need a proper balance of responsibility and reward. Plan the life
  you want to have. You have to negotiate with yourself to give yourselves a good life. You need to know what
  your time is worth to figure out the importance of what you are doing to reach your goals.</p>

        <h2>4: The mind of highly disagreeable people</h2>
        <p>10:09 mins, 2 m views. Agreeable people are compassionate and
  kind. Disagreeable people are aggressive and dominant, looking at the world as a place where you can compete
  and win, with honesty no matter the context. Conscientious people judge you on your skills, agreeable people
  take into account into context. Often they conflict. It's complicated when that happens. It is easy to be
  exploited when you're agreeable. The ability to negotiate on your own behalf is a crucial trait to have in
  life. Agreeable people do not like conflict. It takes a lot of conflict to solve conflicts in the short term.
  Agreeable people often don’t know what they want to find a sense of their own desires in life. It is not
  advantageous when creating a career.</p>

        <h2>5: How to Overcome Social Anxiety</h2>
        <p> 4:40 mins, 8.2 m views. Anxiety is confronting all your fears in life. You cant tell someone to stop thinking about themselves, but you can tell them to look at other people because you can tell what they are thinking. Most people have the ability to talk to others. For example, you can talk to individuals but not a group of people. You know how to talk to one person. Eye contact helps overcome social anxiety because you connect with other people and can understand what others are thinking – which is not judging you. It is also important to conquer your fears in life because you will have the answers to how you can succeed further in life only if you are brave – in this case, this would be social anxiety.</p>

    <h2> Critical Analyses </h2>
    <h3> Analytical Framework </h3>
    <p> To properly analyze Peterson, there must be proper criterion in what a “good” celebrity scientist has to be. The first, and most important, aspect of sharing information must be that is is based in reality. Continuing, the true content must be clear and understandable to follow. The information must also be relevant in the sense that it is based in some aspect of Psychology or Cognitive Science, as Peterson labels himself a scientist. </p>
    <h3> Video Analyses </h3>
    <p> In the first video on critical thinking and writing, he offers a unique perspective of how to think about thinking. This is to say that understanding the concept of laying out an argument is relevant to critical thinking, as that is the basis of strong pieces of writing. This theory is also backed up by scientific research (Çavdar & Doe, 2012). 
In the second video on procrastination, Peterson provides a perspective that brings light to the importance on making goals that are attainable as well as one that you can work on every day to succeed. The importance of creating goals for yourself is demonstrated through many studies (Felkey et al., 2023) and are based in psychology, because having something to look forward to is necessary to live a rewarding life. 
In the video of agreeable and disagreeable people, he claims that it is a beneficial skill to be disagreeable in some circumstances, such as in the workplace, for negotiation and conflict resolution. </p>
      <p>Although this may seem self explanatory, as disagreeable are more often than not characterized as those who prefer to reach goals than to make others happy, there is evidence that disagreeable people perform negatively in the workplace (Anderson et al., 2020). This is to say, disagreeable people do not have any sort of advantage to maintain power in the workplace by being manipulative people. In addition, there is evidence demonsrating that other traits from the big five that often oppose disagreeableness (extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness) are correlated more to aspects such as negotiation and conflict resolution (Yiu & Lee, 2011). </p>
        <p>
In the video on memories and decision making, Jordan Peterson provides a different response to the modern age of trauma and memory storing as a form of learning, it is not to say that all the information and insights provided are based on facts. It is important to think critically about what is being said on social media. Peterson provides a beneficial account of predictive memory without naming it but uses a single and thorough example to provide real-world context to his ideologies. This is not the strongest argument as there are examples that can be used to disprove his ideas on how necessary negative events are in life, and how one must face trauma. Despite this blurry line with modern-age social media, there is also an ever-advancing scientific and peer-reviewed publications providing better insight to these serious topics.

        <h2>Other Analyses</h2>
        <p>In this section, I will be performing other levels of analysis to better understand the content from Jordan Peterson.  </p>
         <p> Looking at Petersons’ most viewed videos, there is a clear connection between the topics in which he discusses. His main focus is the Psychology of behaviour and behaviour management. His talks seem to be fantastical, and by this I mean he uses phrases and key words that grabs the audiences attention as well as brings a strong emotion when you listen to what he says. His argumentation strategy is to have the audience feel some strong emotion, whether that be strongly agreeing or disagreeing to the stance that he takes in Psychology. It is interesting to note that the shorter clips from Peterson, the more views he receives. This may be due to the fact that his shorter clips often are centred around a controversial topic. </p>
        <p>Peterson also uses aspects from Evolutionary Psychology to support his claims and ideologies. This can be seen not only in his talks, but his name in Psychology. Despite his fantastical ideologies, the videos that maintain the most popularity, unsurprisingly, habe the least amount of evidence to support his claims. 
	Petersons approach to talks is to use personal stories that relate to the topic at hand, for example in his talk about disagreeable people, he mentioned his friend, and explain one specific case that he then generalizes to a population of people.
  Note: In bar graph labeled "Jordan Peterson Views and Duration", the bars for the duration aren't large enough to see, indicating the massive gap between the views and duration of his videos. Here is the data from the grapgs, for reference: </p>
        <p> Views: 1900000, 2400000, 2000000, 452000, 8200000 </p>
        <p> Duration: 401, 1109, 1009, 2751, 440 </p>
        <p> Given the general overview of the content that Peterson normally discusses, it is clear that he relies on cognitive biases of the viewers to entrance them into believing his ideas. In previous research, there is a correlation between excessive social media use and cognitive biases (Turel & Serenko, 2020), Peterson uses the “trendy” cognitive science and psychology terms (ie/ anxiety, procrastinating, etc) to drive people to be interested in his talks. </p>
          <p>From then, he uses levels of fear tactics, as well as responsibility tactics (ie/ you are the one responsible for your anxiety, procrastination, etc) to obtain a visceral reaction from the viewers. This gives him the opportunity to gain hundreds of thousands of views because you may either agree with him completely, or disagree with him completely. Either way, he still gets the “click”, which is what he wants. This is not to say that he does not have a background in science, it just simply not align in some cases. Continuing, if you are interested in learning more on the topics that Peterson discusses, obtaining the information from him alone would lead to biased conclusions. This is similar to all celebrity scientists, and social media as a whole. </p>
        <p> Overall, Peterson provides a skewed perception of Cognitive Science to the digital age of media, however this is not uncommon. Although his portrayal of mental health specifically has room for improvement, his ideology on personal responsibility seems to stand with modern research. </p>

  <h1> My Opinion </h1>
  <p> Overall, coming from a celebrity scientist perspective, Jordan Peterson has strong sounding arguments, but when you pull apart his theories and ideas, they are ultimately flawed. His ideas would provide a good base for future theories, however relying heavily on Evolutionary theories causes the issue of disproving his case. As we know, digital data analysis and sharing is at the peak of technology as of 2023, so integrating data evidence into his talks would provide a more solid ground for listeners to trust what he is saying.
One flaw that arises through the mix of Cognitive Science and Digital platforms is the seemingly short period of time in which you can take someones attention. This is also evident in Petersons talks, as he uses his knowledge of how to grab the listeners attention and focuses on that, instead of the unbiased science behind his ideas. 
</p>
        <p> His content seems to also cater to the negativity bias, where individuals are more drawn to negative information, as it is mor memorable in your mind. This is seen by the contnet in his videos, as well as the ACTION below, looking at the sentiment analysis. If you are intersted in other forms of analyzing Peterson, please look at the following ACTION's! </p>
