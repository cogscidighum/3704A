        <h1>Jordan Peterson: Analysis</h1>
      <h2>Video 1: This is how your memories affect your decision making:</h2>
          <p> 27:51 mins, 452,000 views. Jordan Peterson talks about how your memory impacts how you make decisions in your life with a few examples. He declares that the purpose of your memory is to “provide a map for navigating life”, meaning that the memories you form are used to aid you in reacting to events in your life.</p>
He states that you need to have some form of malevolence in your life at an early age to learn how to deal with the good and bad respectively with a level of independence, and if you cannot receive that then you will face the consequences as time passes.
His main example is bullying, and how it can manifest itself with rage over time and progress into murderous fantasies (from a client of his).
His ideology to prevent this in the future, as well as to limit this in current individuals is to self-reflect on how you may have played a part in bad moments and memories in your life, and that all these moments are useful to learn from and make better decisions in your next encounter. Peterson also takes the stance on being assertive in your negative environments early on to prevent the snowball effect of being bullied and other traumatic events that become repetitive in your psyche.</p>
Overall, he states that you need to build a level of immunity and confidence in yourself, so you are prepared for negative events that are inevitable in life, and you need to gain an understanding of your past to learn how to better respond in the future.</p>

          <p>4:01 mins, 1.9 m views. In this video, he claims that people oftentimes do not know how to be critical thinkers in their evironment because they do not know how to write properly and structure their arguments. He states that best way to teach people how to
  critically think is how to write. Because it is time-intensive. There is no difference between that and
  thinking. It helps you learn how to think to act effectively in the world. It helps you form your arguments coherently and you have influence in the world.</p>

        <h2>3: How to stop Procrastinating</h2>

          <p> 11:09 mins, 2.4 m views. Conscientiousness: orderliness and industriousness.
  Working on micro habits, aims, and goals that you value. What are your sources of motivation in life? You can
  think of this from the big five personality traits. The microprocesses become rewarding because you know that
  you are moving forward towards your valued goal. You need to have a valued goal – the bigger, the better.
  Specify your long-term idea and where you want to stay away from (your fears in life). You need to consult the
  main goals in life and what you need to be happy. After creating the goal structure, you aim for it and use
  everything you learn to build yourself to be that person. You need to know when you fail because it teaches
  what you need to change for the future. A schedule is unbelievably useful for this. Set it up so you have the
  day you want every day (with responsibility along with it, you want to be better at the end of the day than
  you were in the beginning of the day). You need a proper balance of responsibility and reward. Plan the life
  you want to have. You have to negotiate with yourself to give yourselves a good life. You need to know what
  your time is worth to figure out the importance of what you are doing to reach your goals.</p>

        <h2>4: The mind of highly disagreeable people
      </h2>

          <p>10:09 mins, 2 m views. Agreeable people are compassionate and
  kind. Disagreeable people are aggressive and dominant, looking at the world as a place where you can compete
  and win, with honesty no matter the context. Conscientious people judge you on your skills, agreeable people
  take into account into context. Often they conflict. It's complicated when that happens. It is easy to be
  exploited when you're agreeable. The ability to negotiate on your own behalf is a crucial trait to have in
  life. Agreeable people do not like conflict. It takes a lot of conflict to solve conflicts in the short term.
  Agreeable people often don’t know what they want to find a sense of their own desires in life. It is not
  advantageous when creating a career.</p>

        <h2>5: How to Overcome Social Anxiety</h2>

          <p> 4:40 mins, 8.2 m views. Anxiety is confronting all your fears in life. You cant tell someone to stop thinking about themselves, but you can tell them to look at other people because you can tell what they are thinking. Most people have the ability to talk to others. For example, you can talk to individuals but not a group of people. You know how to talk to one person. Eye contact helps overcome social anxiety because you connect with other people and can understand what others are thinking – which is not judging you. It is also important to conquer your fears in life because you will have the answers to how you can succeed further in life only if you are brave – in this case, this would be social anxiety.</p>

<h1>In Depth Disscussion of Video 1: </h1>
    <p>
      Jordan Peterson is an infamous name when it comes to the distribution of scientific knowledge in the digital age of the world. A blessing and a curse it is to have such vast knowledge at the touch of a button, but it comes with its flaws. In this video, Peterson describes his empirical research with memory and how past life events can impact your life quality (Peterson, 2023). He uses his example of a patient he encountered. This individual faced the hands of bullying and experienced a large amount of trauma that followed him years into the future. Peterson takes the stance that although unpleasant to deal with, negative events in life, such as bullying, are necessary for cognitive development and the development of proper emotional regulation and the importance of your memory in relation to so. 
      <br><br>
      
      His analogy is from a patient who suffered from intense negative emotions surrounding being bullied in his high school years. This individual had such horrific experiences that he would continue to get psychiatric help from Dr. Peterson on this issue. Peterson used this to explain how you need negativity in life to learn from the experience and grow independently. He claims that when you are a child, the experience of experiencing negative events in life teaches you the dichotomy or so-called “truth" of living, and how you must face those events with a level of confidence as well as responsibility that you are the one who needs to navigate out of these situations. The same is to say about positive events in life. He then hypothesizes that the reason why this individual has been having such issues is from the lack of exposure in childhood, and from the lack of exposure comes a lack of past knowledge that you can use for current experiences. This ideology is confirmed by modern cognitive science, which is known as predictive processing. You use your past experiences and knowledge to aid you in understanding and navigating future experiences.</p>
  <br>
  Interestingly, Peterson's ideology also introduces an aspect of self-reflection in the process. In this example, he brings up how perhaps the individual who was being bullied played a part in the event. He claims that having a level of introspection is key to being a more self-aware person, and to being able to commit to fully using a past event to make your future a more fulfilling one, with less dwelling on the past. Peterson remarks on the fact that confidence is necessary to complete these tasks.
  <br>
  <br>
  Along with this, Peterson makes a claim that dwelling on past trauma is not helpful in the slightest, and an issue that a lot of people are facing in current society is doing so in a way that makes them feel “trapped” and lack confidence. 
This way of thinking about knowledge representation of the world can be compared to the interactive activation model of cognition in the sense that your childhood and “starting information” forms the basis of how your knowledge is represented in your mind. Thus, if you have more exposure to negative experiences then they will be encoded on a deeper level in your mind and will have more connections throughout your brain as compared to a highly inactive one. 
<br>
  <br>
  <h3> Critical Analysis of Video 1 </h3>
  Although some aspects of this talk seem appealing at first glance, it seems to be based on a focus to bring your interest towards what he is saying, and a lack of scientific explanation on Petersons' side, which could help convey his ideas as facts and not simply a “talk”, or YouTube video. In terms of using memories as a blueprint to navigate life, this is proven by what is known as predictive processing in cognitive science. This uses the Bayes model that states that humans use current sensory input of the environment as well as prior knowledge to fully comprehend their surroundings (Newen et al., 2018). This is a cycle where you can use your past knowledge to apply it to current events, and then store current events in your memory to use it in future events. This supposes that humans want to use their brain power in the most efficient way possible, as well as minimize errors in comprehending their surroundings. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Given this, Petersons claim that you need to experience negative events to maintain this prior knowledge of how to understand and navigate life does indeed make sense, as the more you experience, the easier it will be for you to guide yourself with a deeper level of understanding in life. However, it is not clear the extent to which he claims it to be. By this, I mean to what extent is it helpful compared to harmful? As his example is, bullying is a broad category that can range from verbal to physical and psychological. So, although you may gain knowledge from experiencing some name-calling, there are no helpful aspects of facing physical or psychological damage in your formative years.
  <br>
  <br>
  The aspect of self-reflection is a positive aspect of this video that looking at an event from as many perspectives as possible contributes to overall happiness levels. This way of thinking about negative experiences in life can be useful for someone who experienced low-level negative events, but not for someone who is dealing with a large-scale traumatic event. In neuroscience it is evident that trauma changes your brain chemistry, and some individuals may even be diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (Yehuda et al., 2015) because of the trauma, they will not benefit from believing that they are responsible for what happened to them. Along with this, it is not in the best manner to say that people who suffer from these events need to “not dwell” on them. This is quite interesting, as he is a clinical psychologist and has studied the effects of these intensive mental disorders that are founded based on traumatic events in life, but still has a radical notion that you are responsible in some sense for those events. You should have been stronger and moved past it. This is not a permanent solution, as scientific information proves how important it is to understand that sometimes things happen to you that you are not responsible for and that you should not “forget” and move past these fully but use these events as lessons to develop your understanding of the world using the predictive processing framework more deeply. 
  <br>
<h1>  Further Analyses </h1>
    <br>
    <p> Looking at Petersons’ most viewed videos, there is a clear connection between the topics in which he discusses. His main focus is the Psychology of behaviour and behaviour management. His talks seem to be fantastical, and by this I mean he uses phrases and key words that grabs the audiences attention as well as brings a strong emotion when you listen to what he says. His argumentation strategy is to have the audience feel some strong emotion, whether that be strongly agreeing or disagreeing to the stance that he takes in Psychology. It is interesting to note that the shorter clips from Peterson, the more views he receives. This may be due to the fact that his shorter clips often are centred around a controversial topic. Peterson also uses aspects from Evolutionary Psychology to support his claims and ideologies. This can be seen not only in his talks, but his name in Psychology. Despite his fantastical ideologies, the videos that maintain the most popularity, unsurprisingly, habe the least amount of evidence to support his claims. 
	Petersons approach to talks is to use personal stories that relate to the topic at hand, for example in his talk about disagreeable people, he mentioned his friend, and explain one specific case that he then generalizes to a population of people.
  Note: In bar graph labeled "Jordan Peterson Views and Duration", the bars for the duration aren't large enough to see, indicating the massive gap between the views and duration of his videos. </p>
  <h1> My Opinion </h1>
  <p> Overall, coming from a celebrity scientist perspective, Jordan Peterson has strong sounding arguments, but when you pull apart his theories and ideas, they are ultimately flawed. His ideas would provide a good base for future theories, however relying heavily on Evolutionary theories causes the issue of disproving his case. As we know, digital data analysis and sharing is at the peak of technology as of 2023, so integrating data evidence into his talks would provide a more solid ground for listeners to trust what he is saying.
One flaw that arises through the mix of Cognitive Science and Digital platforms is the seemingly short period of time in which you can take someones attention. This is also evident in Petersons talks, as he uses his knowledge of how to grab the listeners attention and focuses on that, instead of the unbiased science behind his ideas. 
</p>
  <br>
  <h3> Alternative Suggestions to Petersons Claims </h3>
  An alternative I would suggest to his ideology of memories being used as a framework to navigate life is to condemn the idea that you are fully responsible for the events now, but how you use that prior knowledge is the more important skill that you can learn in your formative years. The responsibility one holds is that one must put your knowledge to use in a sense where they do uses memories to map out their life, from an evolutionary standpoint. In your formative years, you will be able to use the education given to you in schools, as well as personal experience to develop your schema about life, experiences, physical people, or places you should avoid and how you can maintain your physical and mental well-being for as long as possible.
  <br>
  While there are scientific studies proving that humans use the integration of memories to navigate through life (Newman et al., 2021), there is a lack of evidence supporting that exposure to negative events can be helpful in any way – it shows the opposite in fact. There is proof that repeated exposure to stressful events makes you more susceptible to diseases, such as the common cold (APA PsycNet, n.d.). So, although stressors are naturally occurring in life, it does not mean that you should not fully avoid them that you are able to. 
  <br>
  I would also revise this to include self-reflection as a component in the memory process as solely using memories to help you navigate life would not give you the optimal amount of support in a future unknown environment. My ideology differs from Peterson's because I do not believe you should reflect on yourself negatively. He implies that you need to critically evaluate the role that you played in the negative event, but taking a more positive approach is more helpful in a broader sense. There is evidence in cognitive neuroscience proving the importance of self-reflection and how beneficial it can be that it is the basis of many forms of therapy (Bennett-Levy & Lee, 2012), including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall, it is important to understand the dichotomy of information presented to you in YouTube videos regarding scientific content. Although Jordan Peterson provides a unique response to the modern age of trauma and memory storing as a form of learning, it is not to say that all the information and insights provided are based on facts. It is important to think critically about what is being said on social media. Peterson provides a beneficial account of predictive memory without naming it but uses a single and thorough example to provide real-world context to his ideologies. This is not the strongest argument as there are examples that can be used to disprove his ideas on how necessary negative events are in life, and how one must face trauma. Despite this blurry line with modern-age social media, there is also an ever-advancing scientific and peer-reviewed publications providing better insight to these serious topics.
