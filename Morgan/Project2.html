<h3> Video 1 - Addiction Explained, Rises & Falls in Dopamine | Dr. Andrew Huberman <h3>

<h4> Video 1 Summary/Analysis </h4>
<p>In this video Dr Huberman discusses the science behind addiction and how dopamine plays a role. Huberman provides an example of people who are addicted to cocaine. When a person ingests cocaine via any method, their dopamine levels rise to an excessive amount at a fast rate. This causes the brain to depend on short and rapid releases of dopamine; and associates that increase in dopamine with cocaine. When people engage in other activities that produce dopamine, such as playing sports or exercising this does not offer the same impact of euphoria as cocaine does. This is due to both the short release duration and the rewarding properties of dopamine. The brains of individuals who are addicted to cocaine are wired to expect short and fast releases of dopamine, which in turn makes it difficult for them to pursue things that take longer. After experiencing high levels of dopamine, it is followed by a steep drop in dopamine levels which forces the brain to constantly seek quick sources of dopamine (i.e cocaine). Eventually, when the brain becomes overly addicted to any drug, it shifts the goal of the brain from pleasure to pain and desire. Huberman uses cocaine as an example in this video, however this same concept can be replaced with social media, alcohol or any activity that can repeat this effect; as mentioned by Huberman himself.
<br><br>
I chose this video because I thought it was very simple yet informative in giving a summary of how addiction and dopamine scientifically work together. According to Health Canada, the usage and addiction rate of drugs is on the rise. Therefore, this video explaining the science behind addiction is relevant to today's concerns. Not only do the mechanisms in this video apply to drug usage but also social media. Social media is also very prevalent in today’s society, yet many people are unaware that it can produce similar effects on the brain that cocaine and other drugs can.

<h3> Video 2 - How to Avoid Unnecessary Dopamine Peaks With "Dopamine Stacking" | Dr. Andrew Huberman <h3>

<h4> Video 2 Summary/Analysis </h4>
<p> Dr Huberman explains how we should be cautious about how often we consume things that amplify dopamine and we should limit the stacking of dopamine stimulating behaviors/activities. He suggests we need to create a balance between the amount of dopamine stimulating behaviors one uses because the overuse of external stimulants can cause us to feel unmotivated. An example he provides is pairing caffeine with exercising on a regular basis. Since both caffeine and exercising are dopamine peak inducing behaviors, the over stimulation of our dopamine levels peaking will cause us to crash and no longer want to exercise. Huberman emphasizes that if we are already intrinsically motivated to exercise, then there should be no reason to overuse caffeine on a regular basis. In short, it is unnecessary to layer in additional dopamine-releasing mechanisms for things we are already motivated to do. <p>
<p>I agree with the things discussed in this video titled “How to Avoid Unnecessary Dopamine Peaks With Dopamine Stacking”. Much like Dr Huberman says, I think that over-stacking dopaminergic releasing activities does have diminishing returns in the way that we essentially become desensitized to the things we enjoy. I can personally relate to this video because I used to consume caffeine before going to the gym. At first, this helped me to stay motivated and awake before exercising; however overtime I became dependent on caffeine and was unmotivated to exercise when I had not consumed caffeine prior.

<h4> Video 3 Summary/Analysis </h4>
<p> In video 3 Dr Huberman discusses how to increase our baseline dopamine levels for higher levels of motivation. Huberman states that we need a baseline level of dopamine that allows us to pursue our goals. If our baseline level of dopamine is low then we will have a hard time finding the motivation and drive to do things. The first advice Huberman gives is to get enough sleep. Getting a sufficient amount of sleep restores our dopamine reserves and allows us to have a healthy baseline level of dopamine. The second thing Dr Huberman mentions is our nutrition. Tyrosine, an amino acid that can be found and many foods we eat. Also, tyrosine synthesizes dopamine and can increase the baseline levels of dopamine. The third thing mentioned by Dr Huberman is sunlight. He suggests we need to be exposed to sunlight early in the morning for 10-30 minutes minimum. Getting enough sunlight will increase our cortisol levels for the day, which is good for regulating our stress and blood pressure. In addition, being exposed to sunlight early in the morning allows our hypothalamus and other hormones/glands to elevate our mood and dopamine levels. The final thing mentioned is exercise, because it increases levels of dopamine. Both cardiovascular and resistance style training elevates our baseline levels of dopamine along with giving us dopaminergic releases. These four fundamental things will set our baseline dopamine levels at a healthy level. Setting a baseline level will ensure that we have enough motivation throughout the week to pursue goals and complete tasks.

<h3> Video 4 - How to Stop Procrastination & Increase Motivation | Dr. Andrew Huberman <h3>

<h4> Video 4 Summary/Analysis </h4>
<p> In this video Dr Huberman discusses how putting ourselves into discomfort and pain can help escape procrastination and increase motivation. As learned in the previous videos a demotivated state is caused by a low level of dopamine, therefore to remotivate ourselves we must return our dopamine levels back to higher than baseline. Huberman explains when in a demotivated state we must put ourselves in a position that is considered much harder than the current state we are in. For example, if we are feeling unmotivated and not wanting to finish an assignment, we need to put our state of mind and body into pain/discomfort immediately. The state of discomfort can be something like a cold shower, and the “discomfort” from a cold shower causes us to rebound out of the low/demotivated dopamine state and back to baseline level.  <p>

<h3> Video 5 - Neuroscientist: "We Are Building a Generation of Low Attention"  <h3>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-xf9pCcVOp4?si=NAWuP1yXM04RZCM7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<h4> Video 5 Summary/Analysis </h4>
<p> For the fifth video I kept it the same as the one I had in project 1. One reason for this is because in project 2 I wanted to focus on dopamine, motivation, addiction, attention and social media. Consequently, this video titled Neuroscientist: "we are building a generation of Low attention" conatins all those topics and allows me to make connections between the preceding 4 videos a lot easier. Also, while looking for more videos from Dr Huberman, there were not many videos that are associated with the subjects I wanted for this project. When I searched for videos that talk about dopamine and social media, Dr Huberman does have other videos on this subject matter. However, the principles he discusses in those videos are very similar to this video, so I thought it would be redundant to find another video related to these topics. <br> <br>

(Taken from Project 1) In this video neuroscientist Andrew Huberman states that as a generation our attention spans are decreasing. Huberman's main argument is that people are unable to buffer and control their need for instant pleasure. Our proximity to pleasure today is easily accessible, the main examples Huberman provides are smartphones and social media. Many people today have smartphones, which is bad for us because of how easy it is for us to access instant pleasure with no requirement to pursue. Because of how easily we are able to access this pleasure, it creates a danger for us as we are chasing and over consuming dopamine without any effort; this causes us as a generation to develop lower attention spans and not actually find any enjoyment out of what we are doing; rather we are just becoming addicted to instant dopaminergic rushes. Everytime we scroll through social media such as tiktok or instagram it allows our brains to switch through various sources of dopamine, via scrolling through many different video contents. Normally people are required to go outside or leave the room to obtain multiple sources of dopamine, however with social media we consume thousands of different context switches in a matter of minutes. When people repeat these activities that require no effort to pursue, our motivation tends to become lower. As we overflow ourselves with these instant pleasures they eventually no longer work to give us dopamine rushes, it makes it so that we have no reason to pursue anything; thus creating an unmotivated and low attention span generation. Huberman suggests that we need to self-regulate because of our oversaturated dopamine circuits and control the amount of time we scroll through social media. We need to essentially work for our pleasure and dopamine rewards. Huberman describes this pursuit as “pain”, we need to experience this “pain” which will then make our reward even more rewarding. In addition, we stop engaging in our addictive behavior and our need for instant pleasure fades away. Huberman’s final thoughts are that when we start making ourselves work for pleasure it will make us creative instant pleasures less. It will also make us feel more motivated and focused to pursue better rewards. By doing this we will slowly increase our attention span back to baseline and become less addicted to instant dopaminergic rushes. <p>

<h3> My Thoughts </h3>
<p>Overall I find Andrew Huberman to be a knowledgeable cel sci that brings neuroscience into mainstream media. For project 2 I decided to focus more on dopamine because of how important it is as a topic with its relation to motivation, attention and addiction. In the videos chosen above, Huberman explains how levels of dopamine fluctuations as one the core issues of why we feel unmotivated and/or addicted to certain activities. In videos 1 and 2 Huberman explains the scientific mechanisms behind dopamine and how over-stacking in some activities can be harmful. In video 3 “Improve Your Baseline Dopamine for Motivation & Drive”, Huberman speaks about the importance of having a healthy dopamine baseline. I agree with all the fundamental tips he provides in this video because in general they are good habits to pick up on, while potentially increasing your levels of dopamine. Also, having a healthy baseline level of dopamine allows us to pursue tasks or things of interest. Conversely, having a low level baseline of dopamine limits on our expenditure on attention and motivation. <br><br> 
One main reason I chose Dr Huberman as my cel sci is because I agree with his point that as a generation, people are lacking attention and motivation to pursue goals. The reason for this is because as stated in video 1 and 5, is that many people are addicted to social media and/or drugs. In addition, people who are used to instant dopaminergic releases, via social media or drugs, result in them having lower attention spans and giving up on things that they find disinteresting. In video 5, he explains how our proximity to pleasure/dopamine is too easily accessible via social media and as we know from video 1, when we get instant high levels of dopamine rushes we tend to crash; and the things that used to give us pleasure no longer give us the same instant dopaminergic satisfaction; therefore leaving us craving for instant dopaminergic releases and putting us in a demotivated state. <br> <br> 
In video 4 titled “How to Stop Procrastination & Increase Motivation”, Huberman gives advice on how we can get our baseline level of dopamine back to normal to increase motivation. The concept in this video is something I have to disagree and critique Dr Huberman on. I find that Huberman tends to have an obsession with the idea of experiencing “pain” before we can experience pleasure. Additionally, in video 5 he mentions how people need to experience a sense of “pain” to make the rewards a lot more rewarding. I argue that there is no need to experience any sort of “pain” before the reward. Rather, people should slowly disengage from the behavior that provides them with high levels of dopamine so they do not become reliant on that sensation. For example, as I mentioned in project 1, people should limit the amount of time they spend on social media. This will allow us to not rely on instant dopaminergic releases, but also by limiting our usage, the pleasure from scrolling on social media does not turn into a sense of pain or desire. Also, experiencing “pain” to make a reward even more euphoric is quite odd in my opinion. If we already find pleasure in a certain activity then there is no need to experience any sort of discomfort to make the reward any more pleasurable. I believe his obsession with “pain” is a way of marketing his persona to appeal to people, in the sense that his methods work because of how extreme or strict they are. For instance, in many of his other videos and in video 4, Hubmeran talks about having cold showers. Many people do not have cold showers because of the discomfort, so I believe by him mentioning this idea of “pain” intrigues the minds of the viewers and tricks them to believe that this is some new concept that they have not tried before. Which in turn will cause them to keep watching Dr Huberman’s videos because he piqued their curiosity. <br><br> 
In conclusion, I agree with Dr Huberman's points on how social media, drugs and dopamine are very important in today's society. I believe that relying on these tools to give us a sense of pleasure has diminishing returns. When either of social media and/or drugs are consumed at high levels it causes our brain to rely on high and fast releases of dopamine. Thus, causing us to lack the attention and motivation to do anything that requires more time and focus. Furthermore, I think Dr Huberman is an accessible and knowledgeable person that people can watch to gain information on the science of dopamine and its connection to these factors. The constant fluctuation and chasing of dopamine that people experience can leave people feeling unmotivated to pursue goals, and become addicted to instant dopaminergic releases.
