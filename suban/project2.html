    <h3>Video 1: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr7gY3JyzP8">from AI to Artificial consciousness</a></h3>
    <p>According to Jochua Bach, understanding how our minds function is best achieved through artificial intelligence (AI). AI allows us to test theories by creating computer programs that process information similarly to our brains. Bach suggests that the focus should shift from building systems that pass the Turing test for human intelligence to systems that can perform a Turing test on individuals. Bach introduces the concept of Deep Learning, involving stacked hierarchies of feature detectors with hundreds of layers learning through gradient descent. He distinguishes between Cognitive AI, aimed at understanding minds, and Narrow AI, focused on improving data processing, which is more commonly seen today. In the context of AI, Bach contrasts how algorithms filter information (Narrow AI) with how humans perceive and create a complete mental world. Humans don't filter out details like facial expressions, poses, or lighting but integrate them into a complex mental world built from percepts and extended into mental simulations. Bach emphasizes that human minds are not mere classifiers but simulators and experiencers. He views humans as the byproduct of organisms needing information processing to regulate interactions with the environment. While organisms primarily use feedback loops for information processing, Bach suggests that feedback loops alone are insufficient for inducing behavioral changes.</p>

    <h3>Video 2: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIpUf-Vy2JA">Joshua bach: nature of reality, dreams and consciousness</a></h3>
    <p>Joshua Bach's conversation with Lex Fridman covers a range of fascinating topics, but what particularly captivated my interest were his discussions on consciousness, decision-making, and the potential of artificial intelligence (AI). Bach highlights the similarity between human and machine consciousness while underscoring the crucial distinction of sentience, emphasizing that AI lacks the ability to sense its environment. The conversation delves into the illusion of free will, proposing that our behavior is automatic and predictable based on psychological models. Bach also explores the prospects for AI development through the creation of a "story" or model of the world, challenging the limitations of mathematical language and addressing the role of perception in shaping our reality. In essence, his insights provide a profound exploration of the complexities of the mind, human behavior, and the evolving landscape of AI.</p>

    <h3>Video 3: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CM9yU4zxW0">Jochua Bach on Chat GBT</a></h3>
    <p>In this section of the video, Joscha Bach discusses the potential of large language models like ChatGPT and their ability to automate tasks that rely on language processing. He acknowledges their limitations, such as limited coherence and the inability to construct complexity, but believes that they can still surpass human abilities in certain areas. Bach also compares language models to the human brain, highlighting the differences in their operation and suggesting alternative algorithmic paradigms for future AGI systems. He explores the challenge of determining whether language models truly reason or simply emulate human reasoning, and suggests strategies to improve their performance, such as enlarging the context window and utilizing overnight training. Bach sees potential in combining language models with other modalities and bridging the gap between vision models and language models. Ultimately, he believes that large language models like ChatGPT expand the possibilities for interacting with computers and removing limitations.</p>

    <h3>Video 4: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWB_kd3WdOA">How is human consciousness different from machine consciousness?</a></h3>
    <p>In a video discussion, Joscha Bach, an AI and cognitive computing expert, explains that he sees human and machine consciousness as already quite similar. The key distinction, according to him, is in sentience. Consciousness, for Joscha, involves awareness and making sense of patterns, a trait shared by both humans and AI. However, machines lack natural observation and analysis, requiring a designated purpose. Sentience, knowing what one is doing and its relation to the environment, is absent in AI because it cannot sense its surroundings. Joscha speculates that AI might develop deeper consciousness or sentience in the future, but currently, it can only simulate sentience, not genuinely perceive and understand its environment. The direction of AI's evolution remains uncertain, and whether it merges with biology or proves incompatible is unknown until further progress is made.</p>

    <h3>Video 5: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeXHQts3xYM">Joscha Bach—How to Stop Worrying and Love AI</a></h3>
    <p>In a thought-provoking discussion with Connor Leahy, Joscha Bach explores the intriguing intersections of identity, artificial intelligence (AI), and the future of humanity. Emphasizing the malleability of our sense of self, he proposes shedding the fear of AI by recognizing identity as a construct. Envisioning a future where intelligent design transcends evolution, Bach contemplates the creation of new subspecies, urging alignment with non-human agents to shape a collective destiny. He advocates for embracing the potential of self-organizing intelligence, comparing humanity to a biofilm with divergent languages. Bach also delves into the impact of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), contemplating its transformative effects on planning, decision-making, and the ethical considerations essential for responsible development. The discussion navigates the intricate balance between AGI's potential benefits and risks, urging a thoughtful and ethical approach to guide its evolution.</p>

  <div id="criticism" class="card">
    <strong>Criticism:</strong>
    <p>I believe that Joshua Bach's views on AI and consciousness can sometimes lack empirical evidence, which can raise concerns about its practicality. However, a lot of the time, his answers are well-defined and give a really good perspective, all while maintaining captivating discussions with a diverse range of individuals, and the dialogues are consistently intriguing. While his ideas are quite innovative, he articulates them effectively. He possesses a sound understanding of how society operates, yet he appears uninterested in conforming to popular opinions or conventional wisdom.</p>
