    <p>Joscha Bach (MIT Media Lab and the Harvard Program for Evolutionary Dynamics) is an AI researcher who works and writes about cognitive architectures, mental representation, emotion, social modeling, and multi-agent systems. He is founder of the MicroPsi project, in which virtual agents are constructed and used in a computer model to discover and describe the interactions of emotion, motivation, and cognition of situated agents. Bachâ€™s mission to build a model of the mind is the bedrock research in the creation of Strong AI, i.e. cognition on par with that of a human being. He is especially interested in the philosophy of AI and in the augmentation of the human mind.</p>

    <h2>Summary of videos</h2>

    <h3>Video 1: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr7gY3JyzP8">from AI to Artificial consciousness</a></h3>
    <p>According to Jochua Bach, understanding how our minds function is best achieved through artificial intelligence (AI). AI allows us to test theories by creating computer programs that process information similarly to our brains. Bach suggests that the focus should shift from building systems that pass the Turing test for human intelligence to systems that can perform a Turing test on individuals. Bach introduces the concept of Deep Learning, involving stacked hierarchies of feature detectors with hundreds of layers learning through gradient descent. He distinguishes between Cognitive AI, aimed at understanding minds, and Narrow AI, focused on improving data processing, which is more commonly seen today. In the context of AI, Bach contrasts how algorithms filter information (Narrow AI) with how humans perceive and create a complete mental world. Humans don't filter out details like facial expressions, poses, or lighting but integrate them into a complex mental world built from percepts and extended into mental simulations. Bach emphasizes that human minds are not mere classifiers but simulators and experiencers. He views humans as the byproduct of organisms needing information processing to regulate interactions with the environment. While organisms primarily use feedback loops for information processing, Bach suggests that feedback loops alone are insufficient for inducing behavioral changes.</p>

    <h3>Video 2: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIpUf-Vy2JA">Joshua bach: nature of reality, dreams and consciousness</a></h3>
    <p>Joshua Bach's conversation with Lex Fridman covers a range of fascinating topics, but what particularly captivated my interest were his discussions on consciousness, decision-making, and the potential of artificial intelligence (AI). Bach highlights the similarity between human and machine consciousness while underscoring the crucial distinction of sentience, emphasizing that AI lacks the ability to sense its environment. The conversation delves into the illusion of free will, proposing that our behavior is automatic and predictable based on psychological models. Bach also explores the prospects for AI development through the creation of a "story" or model of the world, challenging the limitations of mathematical language and addressing the role of perception in shaping our reality. In essence, his insights provide a profound exploration of the complexities of the mind, human behavior, and the evolving landscape of AI.</p>

    <h3>Video 3: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CM9yU4zxW0">Jochua Bach on Chat GBT</a></h3>
    <p>In this section of the video, Joscha Bach discusses the potential of large language models like ChatGPT and their ability to automate tasks that rely on language processing. He acknowledges their limitations, such as limited coherence and the inability to construct complexity, but believes that they can still surpass human abilities in certain areas. Bach also compares language models to the human brain, highlighting the differences in their operation and suggesting alternative algorithmic paradigms for future AGI systems. He explores the challenge of determining whether language models truly reason or simply emulate human reasoning, and suggests strategies to improve their performance, such as enlarging the context window and utilizing overnight training. Bach sees potential in combining language models with other modalities and bridging the gap between vision models and language models. Ultimately, he believes that large language models like ChatGPT expand the possibilities for interacting with computers and removing limitations.</p>

    <h3>Video 4: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWB_kd3WdOA">How is human consciousness different from machine consciousness?</a></h3>
    <p>In a video discussion, Joscha Bach, an AI and cognitive computing expert, explains that he sees human and machine consciousness as already quite similar. The key distinction, according to him, is in sentience. Consciousness, for Joscha, involves awareness and making sense of patterns, a trait shared by both humans and AI. However, machines lack natural observation and analysis, requiring a designated purpose. Sentience, knowing what one is doing and its relation to the environment, is absent in AI because it cannot sense its surroundings. Joscha speculates that AI might develop deeper consciousness or sentience in the future, but currently, it can only simulate sentience, not genuinely perceive and understand its environment. The direction of AI's evolution remains uncertain, and whether it merges with biology or proves incompatible is unknown until further progress is made.</p>

   <h3>Video 5: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z02Obj8j6FQ">Joscha Bach and Connor Leahy - HQ VERSION</a></h3>
<p>Joschua Bach participated in a podcast debate with AI Safety activist Connor Leahy on the Existential Risk of Artificial Intelligence. They discussed aligning AGI with human values and the challenges involved. Joschua Bach emphasized that aligning AI with human values is challenging due to the diversity of human values. He argued that values should be rationally derived from understanding the impact of actions on possible futures. The debate also touched on aligning AGI with human society, contemplating regulations, and the potential evolution of self-motivated AI. Joschua Bach highlighted the need for a broader perspective in AI ethics discussions, proposing the development of genuine AGI Ethics. This entails understanding the implications of self-directed non-human intelligent agents, criteria for moral agency, shared purposes, and negotiating conflicts of interest among different intelligent moral agents.</p>

    <strong>Criticism:</strong>
    <p>Starting with the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and consciousness, Joscha Bach takes readers on a thought-provoking journey. His novel viewpoint is apparent even though his beliefs are not well supported by evidence. Of particular note, Bach expresses the belief that, with some acknowledged limits, language models such as ChatGPT have the potential to outperform human capabilities. AI's alignment with human ideals, especially Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), is a critical component. Bach underscores the complex task of reconciling AI with the wide range of human values and the necessity of adopting a more comprehensive viewpoint in conversations about AGI ethics. Although there are doubts regarding the viability of Bach's opinions, his ability to articulate novel concepts and profound social observations makes the exploration of the rapidly changing fields of consciousness and artificial intelligence fascinating. </p>
