        <h2> Introduction</h2>
        <p>Elizabeth Loftus is a professor of psychological sciences at the University of California, Irvine School of Law. She is an expert in human memory, eyewitness testimonies, psychology, and law and has been a consultant in hundreds of cases. She is globally recognized for her research on rich false memory and the misinformation effect as expanded upon in Project 1. As mentioned in the previous project, Loftus developed an interest in the justice system in the 90s because of the rising number of accusations made by people following the recovery of their repressed memories in therapy. Since then, her findings have helped thousands of wrongfully accused individuals and have reformed the way police interrogations are conducted. </p>

        <h2>Video Summary and Concepts Review</h2>
       
       
    
        <p>In the videos, Elizabeth Loftus talks about her research, the malleability and the unreliability of memory, and how the legal system has relied too much on witnesses' testimonies. 
            Loftus has been conducting experiments to test the extent to which one can manipulate or create someone’s memory. She notably conducted research where she would try to implant the memory of the participants getting lost at the mall as a child to see if it was possible and the extent of their recollection. After three suggestive interviews, they had convinced 25% of the participants that this was something they experienced themselves although it was confirmed they never did. This was heavily criticized because some therapists claimed this experience was too common and plausible. Since then, the studies have been recreated by many others with a range of implanted memories going from being attacked by an animal as a child to witnessing someone being possessed. Over the years, some ethical concern has been raised concerning the methods and scenarios used to conduct the studies but the stress caused by the experiments have been deemed small enough and worth it for the findings that came out of them. In addition, participants are debriefed at the end of the studies, they are informed and made aware of the misinformation. Even though the effectiveness of debriefs is still debated, a study reported no long-term negative effect related to one's participation in a false memory study. Returning participants were less likely to report false memories as being true compared to the first time they participated in the study and compared to new participants ( Murphy et al., 2020).
            She also expanded on the concepts she covered in the first video I analyzed by emphasizing how easy it is to change or exaggerate memory and how many details are lost over time. She elaborated on the process and her experience with rich false memories on The Origins Podcast. During that interview, she mentioned how a family member told her she[Elizabeth] was the one who found her mother’s body in the pool when she was a teenager. At first, she denied the claim since she didn’t remember the event that way, but as the days passed, she kept thinking about it and started recollecting the event in a different light. She could picture her mother in the pool and she was associating memories and behaviors from that day with the claim. Only to receive a call from that family member to learn that she wasn’t the one who found the body in the pool. I believe this shows how easy it is to contaminate our memory when provided new information and how we reinterpret memories differently over time. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Furthermore, Elizabeth elaborates on how 300 people were convicted of a crime only to find out years later that they were innocent when DNA testing was developed. The faulty memory of the witnesses was responsible for 75% of these incarcerations.  Talking to other witnesses, watching news coverage of the event, and leading questions during interrogations can all influence one’s recollection of the event. When subjected to a photo lineup, victims go from uncertainly picking the person that resembles their prosecutor the most to absolute certainty that the person picked committed the crime. Discoveries on the malleability of memory has led to changes in many jurisdictions’ practices to limit false memory. However, that doesn’t eliminate the impact of false memory on legal cases. Studies have shown that jurors are more likely to believe the witness when they are confident, exhibit strong emotions, and recollect the event with great detail. As expanded in Project 1, false memories elicit all of those and are hard to distinguish from true memories. Can we trust witness testimonies? According to Elizabeth Loftus, independent corroboration, such as photos and videos is the only thing we can trust to convict someone of a crime. </p>

        <h2>Critical Analysis</h2>
        <p>I do believe that Loftus’ findings have greatly improved the legal system in the United States and possibly in other countries as well. Her findings on the unreliability of memory have shined a light on the extent of the injustices suffered by people being wrongfully accused. In most cases, solely relying on witnesses' testimonies should not be enough to convict someone of a crime. Eye-witness can forget, change or amplify important details of the event, without malicious intentions or conscious awareness. However, I believe that dismissing all testimonies that are not supported by physical proof would not serve justice. In some cases, like cases of child abuse or sexual assault, it can take years for the victims to seek legal action. Loftus generalizes most cases of this nature to false memory, but I believe that many other factors could explain why it took so many years for the stories to come out. Let’s take the USA gymnastics sexual abuse scandal of 2018. For context, Larry Nassar, former national-team doctor for USAG sexually abused hundreds of girls and young women over the two decades he worked with the gymnasts under the pretense of conducting medical treatment. Some victims claimed that the abuse started in the 1990s which means the accusations were made several years after the act. Here are some of the reasons that were given to explain why no accusations were made before, it was supposed to be an honor and privilege to be treated by Nassar, the gymnast could lose their chances at being chosen to participate in the Olympic, the gymnastic organization said they would take care of the allegation and investigate themselves and some young girls didn’t know that the “medical treatment” provided by Nassar were unusual. (Cohen and Shenk, 2020) Is it fair to dismiss  265 victims on the pretext of faulty memory? I believe the discoveries made by Loftus should be remembered in court, however, we need to make more studies on how, if possible, to differentiate true and false memory.</p>
