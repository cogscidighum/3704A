    <p>I was only able to cover three TED talks with this project, as I was ill for the last week and a bit and very busy with other assignments for different classes.</p>

    <h2>Csikszentmihalyi’s perspective</h2>

    <p>A key theme in all three of the TED talks I chose is the idea of flow. Csikszentmihalyi defines flow as “What we do, but we are fully alive, involved with what we do and [in] harmony with the environment around us.” It essentially involves understanding the nature of happiness.</p>

    <p>Csikszentmihalyi’s model says that you should be enjoying things just at the “edge of your abilities”, meaning that you should be challenged but not overwhelmed. He also said that we experience the necessity of complying with external rules and demands, not all of which are necessarily enjoyable. Additionally, he said that there are three different elements that go into making a good life: pleasure, engagement and meaning.</p>

    <p>In the “Rules of Engagement” TED talk, he said that you should feel like what you are doing connects you to something greater when you are in flow. As Csikszentmihalyi discussed in the “Flow” TED talk from 2004, he ended up getting into psychology after meeting the Swiss psychologist Carl Jung at a lecture and subsequently reading some of his books.</p>

    <p>He decided to study people who had accomplished meaningful things in life. A major example he gave was that of Masaru Ibuka, the co-founder of Sony and a highly successful entrepreneur. Ibuka established a workplace where engineers felt the joy of technological innovation and were aware of their mission to society, and understood that this was a meaningful way of life. Another example Csikszentmihalyi provided was that of Norman Augustine, the CEO of Lockheed Martin, who defined success as “Being happy while doing what you’re doing”.</p>

    <h2>Agree/disagree with his perspective</h2>

    <p>I agree with his perspective, as I have often experienced flow during some activities, such as when playing video games. Video games are generally designed to form a state of flow, and achieve this in several ways, such as supporting social interaction and challenging but not overwhelming the player. This is central to the concept of flow.</p>
