    <h2>1. Csikszentmihalyi’s perspective</h2>
    <p>Firstly, a key part of Csikszentmihalyi’s idea of flow involves understanding what contributes to a life that is worth living and the "roots of happiness". </p>
    <p> As shown in <em>Figure 1</em>, which Csikszentmihalyi discussed in the podcast, after a certain basic point, increases in material well-being do not seem to affect </p>
    <p> how happy people are. Flow is essentially an analogy for a mental state where you do not feel like you are doing your ordinary routines. An example that he provides is </p>
    <p> writing a poem. When writing a poem, a poet often experiences a state of flow: whole parts of the poem "arrive" in the poet’s mind all at once.</p>

    <p>Csikszentmihalyi identified the 7 main steps of Flow. These are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1. Completely involved in what we are doing – focused, concentrated.</li>
        <li>2. A sense of ecstasy – of being outside everyday reality.</li>
        <li>3. Great inner clarity – knowing what needs to be done, and how well we are doing.</li>
        <li>4. Knowing that the activity is doable – that our skills are adequate to the task.</li>
        <li>5. A sense of serenity – no worries about oneself, and a feeling of growing beyond the boundaries of the ego.</li>
        <li>6. Timelessness – thoroughly focused on the present, hours seem to pass by in minutes.</li>
        <li>7. Intrinsic motivation – whatever produces flow becomes its own reward.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>2. Agree/disagree with his perspective</h2>
    <p>I agree with his perspective. I have often experienced flow myself when playing video games. This experience can be described in several ways: losing track of time</p> 
    <p>(step 6 in the list above), heightened focus on a task (step 1), and losing track of your surroundings (step 2) (Zubek, 2020).</p> 
    <p>Games are designed to create a state of flow. They achieve this in several ways (Kraut et al, 2012, Chapter 2):</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Making games challenging but not overwhelming (step 4)</li>
        <li>Setting clear goals for and providing feedback in games (step 3)</li>
        <li>Supporting social interaction in games (step 5)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>In particular, making a game challenging is central to the idea of flow. As a player masters the game, learning to play the game should be fun.</p> 
    <p>The level of skill should increase with the experience of the player (Zubek, 2020). The game should neither be too easy nor too difficult.</p>  
    <p>Flow is also used to create intrinsic motivation (step 7): gaining mastery of a game is inherently interesting to players (Zubek, 2020).</p>
    
    <h2>3. Alternatives</h2>
    <p>A somewhat different view is presented by Koster (2004), as cited by Zubek (2020).</p> 
        <p>He argues that players will experience fun when they are able to "predict outcomes" within the game, for example navigating a difficult level</p>
        <p>in a platform game. As Zubek argues, this perspective comes from the standpoint of game design rather than cognitive science.</p> 
        <p>However, the implication of this perspective is similar to the flow perspective. The game’s level of challenge has to keep increasing with the player’s skill level.</p>
        <p>This has to be done in such a way that the increases in difficulty are both challenging and doable for the player.</p>
    
    <p>Another alternative explanation is that players are mainly extrinsically motivated, not intrinsically motivated Zubek, 2020).</p> 
        <p>A point to support this argument would leaderboards used in many online games which encourage players to compete against each other for</p> 
        <p>higher positions as well as for prizes. In this case, players are not primarily motivated by learning the game mechanics, but by receiving a reward,</p> 
        <p>such a prize or special status.</p>
