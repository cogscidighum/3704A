    <p>Slavoj Žižek is a Slovenian philosopher whose work touches on many topics including psychology, politics, and pop culture. He is primarily influenced by Marxist, Idealist, and psychoanalytic theory– specifically that of Jacques Lacan. Despite his roots in the political world of former Yugoslavia, Žižek has become somewhat of a niche intellectual celebrity in North America due to his unique personality, dry humour and evolving ideology.</p>

<h3 id="The-Most-Dangerous-Philosopher"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XS_Lzo4S8lA">The Most Dangerous Philosopher in the West</a></h3>
<p>
In this Interview by Vice, reporter Alex Miller gets to know Žižek in the intimate setting of his own home in Slovenia with the goal of finding out why he’s been named “the most dangerous philosopher in the west”. Via his humble apartment, viewers have the pleasure of peeking inside Žižek’s mind as he discusses personal life, politics, and pop culture.
<br><br>
Miller begins by walking around the city with Žižek, where the philosopher remarks on how much the locals hate him. But of course, this only adds to his quirky charm. Once inside, he answers Miller’s inquiry about why he’s described as a dangerous philosopher— by comparing himself to the Joker from Batman, meaning that when he has power he “can be a Stalinist”. Miller then attempts to ask about Žižek’s (at the time) latest film <i>The Pervert's Guide to Ideology</i>, in which he illustrates various ideologies using different cinematic pieces. In response, Žižek emphasizes his self hatred, claiming he has not watched the film because he’s too disgusted seeing himself on screen. Nevertheless, he discusses how the film dissects the world’s current ideology through Hollywood movies. He also goes on to discuss world events, with his own Žižek flair, of course.

	<h3 id="Synthetic-Sex"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xYO-VMZUGo&list=PL5uULy4b0kV6OoAFB-Nd8nG8gzwsBMtkY">Synthetic Sex and “Being Yourself”</a></h3>
<p>
Žižek starts off this talk by expressing his disapproval of online dating apps. In his view, users are compelled to put forth a perfected version of themselves that is idealistic to how they want to be perceived. But he maintains that this method of dating is too far removed from love in real life to be genuine. 
<br><br>
However, Žižek also objects to “being yourself” too much. He believes most people are secretly “monsters”, and should actually maintain an image for the sake of politeness. In fact, in his ideal world people can do anything they want except expressing themselves.
<br><br>
He then goes on to tell a joke about his ideal date (although he only seems to be half satirical). In this scenario, the woman he’s interested in would come back to his place where they would both bring out automated sex toys. However, they would not use them on each other. Rather, the two machines would have sex in the background, allowing the two humans to talk and truly be romantic without the pressure of performing well during sex.

<h3 id="Democracy-and-Capitalism"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXVEnxtZe_w&list=PL5uULy4b0kV6OoAFB-Nd8nG8gzwsBMtkY&index=13">Democracy and Capitalism Are Destined to Split Up</a></h3>
<p>
In this talk, we shift to Žižek’s political side as he makes the claim that democracy and capitalism will soon have to separate. In this argument he has two main points. First, he asserts that capitalism is now so efficient that it no longer needs democracy to proceed. Second, he complains that leftists today advocate for local grassroots democracy where people are directly engaged with politics rather than democracy in which a representative you have never met acts for you. He says this is a “nice idea” but cannot be the solution as most people don’t actually want to be engaged in politics at all times. Rather, Žižek argues that the big issues of today are all issues of commons, meaning we need large scale solutions of regulation, not local ones. 
<br><br>
One example he uses is that of the environment. This is a problem of commons in that nature should not be privatized, and yet corporations make it seem like an individualized problem, making us feel guilty if we don’t do small actions like recycling then capitalizing on this guilt by surcharging for “green” products. Unfortunately, people tend to fall into this trap instead of considering the wider system they are under.

<h3 id="Freedom-Today"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpPuTaP68Dw">What Is Freedom Today?</a></h3>
<p>

Žižek tackles this loaded question by first acknowledging that he would love to have the state and other entities taking care of society without his involvement, consent, or knowledge, so that he is free to choose to do whatever he wants. However, he asserts that “free choice” in this system is not really free, but is predetermined. This non-freedom is extremely dangerous as the general public is not aware that they are not free— even believing the opposite. 
<br><br>
Žižek goes on to define his personal highest form of freedom, that being to fall in love. He believes that to love is to completely dedicate yourself to one person, thereby renouncing your freedom of sexual choice, which he oddly finds the most freedom in. But unfortunately, he has observed that modern love, including online dating, is often thought of without the fall— stripping away this ultimate freedom.
<br><br>
So what is true freedom? Žižek concludes it is “questioning everything, including the notion of freedom itself.”

<h3 id="The-Philosophy-of-Barbie"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n8oD6X-zO4">The Philosophy of Barbie</a></h3>
<p>In this podcast clip with youtuber Alex O’Connor, Žižek discusses his recent article for the New Statesman in which he relates our ideas of reality to <i>Barbie</i>, <i>Oppenheimer</i>, and other films. Surprisingly (or maybe not so surprisingly), Žižek reveals he had not watched <i>Barbie</i> nor <i>Oppenheimer</i> before writing the article. This doesn’t appear to be a problem, however, as he still effectively discusses how these movies all involve some sort of passage between reality and an alternative world— Barbie from Barbieland to the human world, and Oppenheimer from safe academia to the harsh world of war.
<br><br>
Since writing the New Statesman article, though, Žižek has watched Barbie and has more to say about it. He brings up the question of why we, in our sexualized world, imagine and enjoy the asexualized Barbieland. He now somehow progresses to an anecdote about pornography, but ultimately makes his conclusion from a psychoanalytic standpoint: even when we are engaged in a sexual act, we are never without fantasy.</p>
