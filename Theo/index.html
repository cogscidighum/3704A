            <p>Psychologist Elizabeth Loftus talks about the creation of false memories: situations where people recall details of events differently from what actually occurred, or sometimes remember events that never happened at all. According to Loftus, the creation of false memories is much more common than most people think. She shares stories and statistics detailing cases of gross errors in memory recollection.</p>
