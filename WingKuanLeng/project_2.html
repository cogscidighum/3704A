        <p>Dive in deeper on decision making;  Daniel Kahneman’s famous dual processing System 1 and System 2 continuation….
          System 1 relies on our intuition, system 2 is defined by our effort, it is suggested that when people tend to focus on one thing, we cannot focus on other things at the same time. 
          Daniel Kahneman made an example in one of his videos “A Closer Look at decision making with Daniel Kahneman”, suggesting that an experienced physician who is in the medical field has great intuition in deciding on a diagnosis or disease. 
          He emphasizes that by questioning if an experienced doctor can always rely on intuition.  “Does the doctor know that he doesn't know”. Is the diagnosis 100 percent accurate, will there be false positive results? This leads to problems in intuition, 
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> “Intuition feels just the same when is wrong and when is right” </strong> Therefore, intuition is just a subjective judgment. He suggested that when people make decisions, we tend to like using the shortcut, we like everything to be fast, but sometimes going too fast, and always relying on our intuition can lead to erroneous. Thus, he suggested that we should slow down when making decisions. Sometimes is useful to take a step back and ask for advice from other people before making decisions. “ Get advice from someone who likes you but does not care too much about your feelings”
        </p>
        <p> This relates to one of his videos talking about why people make bad decisions about money, he suggested that people tend to think of things narrowly. The main takeaway from that video is to encourage people to broaden their views on things in life to make better decisions. Broadening our views allows us to take it down a notch, ask for greater recommendations or direction, and hence enhance our decision-making. </p>
        <p>Almost every moment in our lives, people have to make judgments or decisions. Whether is choosing what to eat for lunch, going to school, deciding how to spend our time and so much more. These moments affect our emotions and create the lives that we are experiencing. Every person is unique and has own perspective on everything because each individual has their own distinct experience. Therefore, when people tend to create unnoticeable noise that affects human judgment. This comes to the topic introduced by Daniel Kahneman about “Noise”. He published another book with other colleagues called Noise: A Flaw in Human Judgment by Daniel Kahneman, Cass R. Sunstein, and Olivier Sibony. This content about the book is shared in the last three videos. </p>
        <p> <strong> "Wherever there is judgment, there is noise and more of it than you think"  </strong></p>
        <p> Starting with this quote above, he made an example in the book and the video in which he called it “Noise audit” is about how underwrites in the field of insurance set annual premiums at both the lowest and highest value, which creates a wide variance that suggests that they are making mistakes in setting the premium. This mistake would lead problems to for an insurance company where they would be at risk of either underpricing or winning unprofitable business. </p>
        <p> <strong> “Some judgments are biases; they are systematically off target. Other judgments are noisy, as people who are expected to agree, end up at very different points around the target” </strong> </p>
        <p> Daniel suggests that the fundamental reason for the noise is the way people make judgments based on their own objective and rational decisions. As mentioned earlier, everyone is unique in their way, people experience different things, and judgment is often influenced by other factors that are often related to subjective feelings that depend on the mood or context which may lead to subjective bias. </p>
        <p>One of the suggestions to deal with noise in judgment is to “ measure it and identify how much noise there is.” Daniel Kahneman also suggested one of the most radical solutions to solve the noise problem which is utilizing algorithms. He gave an example from the book suggesting that deep learning algorithms are used in the medical field, artificial intelligence uses algorithms to detect lymph node metastases in women with breast cancer. This could reduce the noise or bias both on the perspective of the intuition or the experience of a doctor as mentioned earlier on how doctors diagnose disease. Moreover, this algorithm is more likely to be more advanced in the future to reduce both bias and noise which allows to save more lives. </p>
        <p>However, algorithms of course they have their limitations and may not be practical for many situations. As mentioned in class of CognitiveScience and Digital Humanities, AI is created by algorithms, and algorithms can be programmed to learn but only to a certain extent. Algorithms can learn from the data being input to detect disease but the final decision or treatment also has to rely on the judgment of the doctors. The algorithms would allow us to reduce the noise and provide an opportunity to make better decisions. In my opinion, I agree that algorithms would be really helpful in terms of reducing noise in making judgments but algorithms or AI would not be able to replace human judgment. There are many other components that we have to consider to propose that AI can replace humans, components such as consciousness, ethical implications, social acceptance, and many others. </p>
        <p> AI is a really powerful tool, it offers efficiency gains, creativity, and innovations across diverse domains. Its ability to automate, analyze, or store vast datasets allows us to have the opportunity to lead to many advancements that can help us solve problems and make the way people do things more efficient. However, it all comes up to a point where people always like using shortcuts, ask Daniel Kahneman suggests in System 1, that people are more prone to use the fastest way( system 1) to achieve things. Thus, I think this is why we have all this advanced technology now that is available for us to make our lives better. </p>
        <p> Overall, does technology truly enhance our lives? This could lead to further discussion, but I believe that these advanced technologies that we know are created by the decisions made by people. We are constantly making judgments about how to make lives better and faster but sometimes, it is also crucial to take a step back and slow down while deciding because at times people will make wrong decisions. </p>

        <p>From these five videos about Daniel Kahneman, the highest view is the video about Daniel Kahneman: Why We Make Bad Decisions About Money (And What We Can Do About It), it seems that people are curious and want to know more about decision-making that relates to financial management. Decision making in financial management is a critical aspect for any business, organization, and also personal finance management. </p>
