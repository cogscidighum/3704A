          Dive in deeper on decision making; Daniel Kahneman’s famous dual processing System 1 and System 2
          continuation…. System 1 relies on our intuition, system 2 is defined by our effort, it is suggested that
          when people tend to focus on one thing, we cannot focus on other things at the same time. Daniel Kahneman
          made an example in one of his videos, suggesting that an experienced physician who is in the medical field has
          great intuition in deciding on a diagnosis or diseases. He emphasizes that by questioning if an experienced
          doctor can always rely on intuition. “Does the doctor know that he doesn't know”. Does the diagnosis 100
          percent accurate, will there be false positive results? This leads to problems in intuition,
        </p>
        <p>
           <strong> “Intuition feels just the same when is wrong and when is right”  </strong> Therefore, intuition is just a subjective
          judgment. He suggested that when people make decisions, we tend to like using the shortcut, we like everything
          to be fast, but sometimes going too fast, and always relying on our intuition can lead to erroneous. Thus, he
          suggested that we should slow down when making decisions. Sometimes is useful to take a step back and ask for
          advice from other people before making decisions. “ Get advice from someone who likes you but does not care
          too much about your feelings”
        </p>
        <p>
          This relates to one of his videos talking about why people make bad decisions about money, he suggested that
          people tend to think of things narrowly. The main takeaway from that video is to encourage people to broaden
          their views on things in life to make better decisions. Broadening our views allows us to take it down a
          notch, ask for greater recommendations or direction, and hence enhance our decision-making.

          Almost every moment in our lives, people have to make judgments or decisions. Whether is choosing what to eat for lunch, going to school, deciding how to spend our time and so much more. These moments affect our emotions and create the lives that we are experiencing. Every person is unique and has own perspective on everything because each individual has their own distinct experience. Therefore, when people tend to create unnoticeable noise that affects human judgment. This comes to the topic introduced by Daniel Kahneman about “Noise”. He published another book with other colleagues called Noise: A Flaw in Human Judgment by Daniel Kahneman, Cass R. Sunstein, and Olivier Sibony.

<strong> "Wherever there is judgment, there is noise and more of it than you think," </strong>
Starting with this quote above, he made an example in the book about how underwrites in the field of insurance set annual premiums at both the lowest and highest value, which creates a wide variance that suggests that they are making mistakes in setting the premium. This mistake would lead problems to for an insurance company where they would be at risk of either underpricing or winning unprofitable business. 

<strong> “Some judgments are biases; they are systematically off target. Other judgments are noisy, as people who are expected to agree, end up at very different points around the target” </strong>

It is suggested by Daniel that the fundamental reason for the noise is the way people make judgments based on their own objective and rational decisions. As mentioned earlier, everyone is unique in their way, people experience different things, and judgment is often influenced by other factors that are often related to subjective feelings that depend on the mood or context which may lead to subjective bias.
