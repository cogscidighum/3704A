  Dr. Lara Boyd's insightful video, “ After watching this, your brain will not be the same”,  on brain research explores the concept of neuroplasticity and its connection to our everyday experiences and behaviors on the human brain. Dr. Boyd begins her presentation by dispelling common misconceptions about the brain, including the outdated belief that it stops changing after childhood. She emphasizes, "Every time you learn something new, your brain changes," highlighting the core principle of neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to reorganize and form new connections which is primarily driven by the activities we engage in. This means that what we do, learn, and practice plays a central role in shaping our brain's structure and function.

 Dr. Boyd proceeds to explain the three fundamental ways in which the brain adapts to support learning, encompassing chemical adjustments, structural modifications, and functional adaptations.
