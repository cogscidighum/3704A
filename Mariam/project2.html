   <h1>Critical Analysis: How Does Stress Affect Learning?</h1>
  In Lara Boyd's TEDx Talk, "How Does Stress Affect Learning," she delves into the significant influence of stress on our learning abilities and the resulting effects on our brains. The discussion covers the physical impact of stress on our bodies,the process of learning within the brain, and discusses strategies to counteract the negative consequences of stress on the learning process.


<p id="space">
Cortisol, a vital hormone in our bodies, manages various crucial functions. It regulates blood pressure, ensuring it stays in a healthy range, and balances blood glucose levels for energy. Additionally, cortisol supports our immune system and provides a boost during challenges, like before a test or race. However, when stress persists, high cortisol levels bring potential issues such as bone density loss, muscle mass reduction, increased inflammation, and added abdominal fat. The larger concern is the interference of excess cortisol with clear thinking, as mentioned by Dr. Boyd.  An example provided is that of  that state being extremely stressed and being unable to form a thought. This occurrence is due to cortisol interference with our ability to learn. This interference can create a sense of overwhelming stress, making it challenging to form clear thoughts.

 <p id="space">
 Dr.Lara boyd states, “Everything we do, Everything we experience is causing us to learn and it’s changing your brain”. This brain change in response to learning is called Neuroplasticity, as we learn we change brain cells.Our brains are  made up of billions of individual cells, known as neurons. Neurons communicate with one another by sending chemical signals.  Dr.Boyd highlights that when we learn something new, the chemical concentration in our brain changes very rapidly. This mechanism is supported by the formation of a short term-memory, which is very fragile and easily forgotten. To truly remember and learn something,  the short term has to be converted into a long term memory.  She explains that long term memories are relatively permanent, giving the example of once you learn to ride a bike, you continue to go on to ride any bike and never forget.  However, long term memory takes a lot of practice or studying and sleep.
To relate this concept back to high levels of cortisol, they interfere with transformation of short term memories into long term memories. As for long timer memories to be created, there are chemicals involved called growth factors which facilitate the formation of long term memories. Growth factors directly support learning.  “In our  brain growth factors and cortisol compete” , which impairs our learning. 

 <p id="space">
Furthermore, Dr. Boyd states “the singlest largest drive of neuroplasticity is our behavior”, allowing us to adopt different behaviors to help our brain learn. Dr. Boyd suggests that there are many ways to help our brain learn. One way is through exercise which has a great influence on the brain, Dr. Boyd research found that a single session of intense exercise can change cortical excitability, alter brain function and promote learning. More specifically, she found that any form of  exercise facilitates the transformation of a short term memory into longer term memory, all while reducing cortisol.  Secondly, sleep was discussed to play an important role in converting short term memories to long term. Six to eight hours a night is found to lower cortisol by 50%, highlighting the  importance of sleep. 
 <p id="space">
  Another amazing finding in Dr.Lara Boyd’s research on comparing yoga and running. Surprisingly, although runners were more physically fit, people who did yoga had lower stress and a better response to stressful situations in their brains. Dr. Boyd highlights the key aspect of mindfulness that comes with it.  Mindfulness can help by lowering stress, giving our brains a rest, and making it easier for us to learn.  This is very relevant as in today's world,  we can rarely let our brains rest due to technology driven lives. 

  <p id="space">
    Dr. Boyd emphasizes the importance of looking after our brains, as through all of life's stress and changes, we've only got one. To intentionally influence how stress affects our brains, she suggests  activities like exercise, enough sleep, and mindfulness. Regardless of age or the subject we're learning, each of these practices not only reduces stress but also enhances our brain health. Dr. Boyd's message reminds us that we have the power to create spaces in our brains for better learning and less stress, and it's something we should all prioritize.

   <p id="intro">
    In this insightful video on Stroke Recovery by Dr. Lara Boyd , the remarkable plasticity of the brain is highlighted, emphasizing that every action we take contributes to its dynamic structure. She begins by highlighting the transformative nature of the brain, stating, "What we've started to learn or learned in the last 10 to 15 years is that the brain is this amazingly dynamic structure. Everything you do changes your brain". This creates a deeper exploration into the understanding of the brain's capacity for change and adaptation.
  <p id="space">
    Researchers have been able to identify specific parts of the brain that undergo changes and explore the reasons behind these transformations, revealing the complex workings of neural plasticity. Boyd expresses that the significance of this discovery allows for new avenues of exploration, ranging from childhood learning to stroke recovery. As well, she expresses her passion on how the  brain defines who we are, and the ability to influence its structure provides a unique opportunity for personal growth and development.
  <p id="space">
   Dr. Boyd emphasizes the plasticity of the brain, stating, "If you learn new things, take new opportunities, and start participating in new activities, you're changing who you are." This concept introduces the idea of endless possibilities, where individuals can actively shape their identities through continuous learning and engagement in new experiences.
  <p id="space">
   Boyd passionately discusses the rapid advancements in neuroscience about the brain that  opens up new fields, new areas of education, areas of medicine quickly. As Dr. Boyd looks to the future in hopes for a new cycle of discovery that could lead to the development of highly effective therapies for individuals who have experienced strokes or acquired brain damage. Recognizing the impact of strokes, she stresses the need for better therapies, given that stroke is the third leading cause of death worldwide and the primary cause of long-term adult disability. 
  <p id="space">
   In conclusion, Lara Boyd's optimism and passion shine through as she envisions a future marked by groundbreaking discoveries in neuroscience, expressing hope for improved therapies and a deeper understanding of the brain's incredible potential.

   <p id="intro">

    In the discussion on Educational Neuroplasticity, Dr. Lara Boyd emphasizes the dynamic nature of the brain's ability to change throughout our lifespan. She highlights the key driver of neuroplastic change as behavior where  positive behaviors such as learning and growth can have beneficial effects on the brain. While negative behaviors, such as an inactive lifestyle, can lead towards negative changes. Dr. Boyd states three main processes through which neuroplastic change occurs: changes in brain chemistry, alterations in brain structure, and modifications in how different brain regions function together. These processes work together in enhancing our ability to learn and change, making neuroplasticity an interesting aspect of neuroscience research.

  <p id="space">
   Educational neuroplasticity is a critical focus in Dr. Boyd's discussion, raising  questions about the limitations and facilitators of learning. While expressing the brain's amazing aspects, she acknowledges challenges and instances where individuals struggle to learn specific skills or languages. Drawing from her expertise in studying stroke recovery, Dr. Boyd transitions to an advanced field of educational neuroplasticity. She criticizes traditional education systems as prolonged and poorly controlled neuroscience experiments, emphasizing the need to create interventions to individual children's needs. This new field would alter more informed and personalized educational strategies, optimizing the learning experience for each student.
  <p id="space">
   Dr. Boyd concludes with an optimistic outlook on the future of educational neuroscience and neuroplasticity. She recognizes the challenges of creating personalized interventions due to the unique and diverse ways individuals change their brains.  The expertise of neuroscientists, educators, and policy scientists is discussed, to work together to enhance education for everyone. Their primary goal is to apply the principles of neuroplasticity and learning from each expertise , creating more effective and personalized educational strategies.
