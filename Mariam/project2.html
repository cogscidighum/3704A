   <h1>Critical Analysis</h1>
  In Lara Boyd's TEDx Talk, "How Does Stress Affect Learning," she delves into the significant influence of stress on our learning abilities and the resulting effects on our brains. The discussion covers the physical impact of stress on our bodies, the complex process of learning within the brain, and discusses strategies to counteract the negative consequences of stress on the learning process.

Cortisol, a vital hormone in our bodies, manages various crucial functions. It regulates blood pressure, ensuring it stays in a healthy range, and balances blood glucose levels for energy. Additionally, cortisol supports our immune system and provides a boost during challenges, like before a test or race. However, when stress persists, high cortisol levels bring potential issues such as bone density loss, muscle mass reduction, increased inflammation, and added abdominal fat. The larger concern is the interference of excess cortisol with clear thinking, as mentioned by Dr. Boyd.  An example provided is that of  that state being extremely stressed and being unable to form a thought. This occurrence is due to cortisol interference with our ability to learn. This interference can create a sense of overwhelming stress, making it challenging to form clear thoughts.

 Dr.Lara boyd states, “Everything we do, Everything we experience is causing us to learn and it’s changing your brain”. This brain change in response to learning is called Neuroplasticity, as we learn we change brain cells.Our brains are  made up of billions of individual cells, known as neurons. Neurons communicate with one another by sending chemical signals.  Dr.Boyd highlights that when we learn something new, the chemical concentration in our brain changes very rapidly. This mechanism is supported by the formation of a short term-memory, which is very fragile and easily forgotten. To truly remember and learn something,  the short term has to be converted into a long term memory.  She explains that long term memories are relatively permanent, giving the example of once you learn to ride a bike, you continue to go on to ride any bike and never forget.  However, long term memory takes a lot of practice or studying and sleep.
To relate this concept back to high levels of cortisol, they interfere with transformation of short term memories into long term memories. As for long timer memories to be created, there are chemicals involved called growth factors which facilitate the formation of long term memories. Growth factors directly support learning.  “In our  brain growth factors and cortisol compete” , which impairs our learning.

Furthermore, Dr. Boyd states “the singlest largest drive of neuroplasticity is our behavior”, allowing us to adopt different behaviors to help our brain learn. Dr. Boyd suggests that there are many ways to help our brain learn. One way is through exercise which has a great influence on the brain, Dr. Boyd research found that a single session of intense exercise can change cortical excitability, alter brain function and promote learning. More specifically, she found that any form of  exercise facilitates the transformation of a short term memory into longer term memory, all while reducing cortisol.  Secondly, sleep was discussed to play an important role in converting short term memories to long term. Six to eight hours a night is found to lower cortisol by 50%, highlighting the  importance of sleep.

  Another amazing finding in Dr.Lara Boyd’s research on comparing yoga and running. Surprisingly, although runners were more physically fit, people who did yoga had lower stress and a better response to stressful situations in their brains. Dr. Boyd highlights the key aspect of mindfulness that comes with it.  Mindfulness can help by lowering stress, giving our brains a rest, and making it easier for us to learn.  This is very relevant as in today's world,  we can rarely let our brains rest due to technology driven lives.

    Dr. Boyd emphasizes the importance of looking after our brains, as through all of life's stress and changes, we've only got one. To intentionally influence how stress affects our brains, she suggests  activities like exercise, enough sleep, and mindfulness. Regardless of age or the subject we're learning, each of these practices not only reduces stress but also enhances our brain health. Dr. Boyd's message reminds us that we have the power to create spaces in our brains for better learning and less stress, and it's something we should all prioritize.
