        <h3>A Nuanced Approach to Personal Growth</h3>
        Personal growth is the process of continually refining oneself, and it is an ongoing endeavour
        that never truly ceases. This self-refinement is a recurring idea in the videos of YouTube 
        creator Nathaniel Drew, especially as it concerns our cognitive state of mind. The experiences
        he shares detailing his experiments offer strong insights into the nature of humans, and how we
        various techniques or ideas are more conducive to personal growth than others. Some skills he
        emphasizes include mindfulness, self-acceptance, and finding balance in a hyperactive world. An
        investigation into five of his popular videos reveals how they all link together, and the 
        overarching themes coalescing into his comprehensive worldview. Drew is no expert, but merely
        someone interested in sharing innovative ideas in an accessible way; that is, it is as much of
        a learning experience for him as it is for his viewers. In today’s world, the topics he covers
        are extremely relevant, as it is difficult to find a moment of peace in our online 
        technology-centric society. Drew’s approach helps to bridge the gap amongst a documentary, 
        self-reflection, and an educational experience. He creates an accessible environment for 
        people to critically reflect on their own lives, and to feel inspired to make a change by exploring
        these topics for themselves. In this paper, I will argue that content aimed towards personal growth
        is most effective when presented as a documentation of one’s experiences, rather than as impersonal
        and information-based. <br>
        <h3>Technology and the Lure of Misinformation</h3>
        Consequently, what must we consider when portraying such videos, and why do they help at all? In 
        recent years, technology has become the de-facto source of information for most of advanced 
        civilization, which is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, technology is an excellent resource
        for reaching people and sharing information, while on the other hand, it allows for large-scale
        propaganda and misinformation campaigns (Southwell et al., 2018). The format in which Drew presents
        his videos actively combats the latter and promotes the former through digestibility and public 
        availability. He not only posts on YouTube, a vastly popular website, but also sends out a free 
        newsletter to those who choose to subscribe. As previously mentioned, Drew constantly reiterates 
        his status as an amateur, and the exploratory nature of his experiments. They exist to inspire and
        encourage others to do the same, offering a sense of direction in a world distinctly lacking clear,
        objective purpose. Each of his videos is a view into his own mind; and carefully thought out opinion
        piece meant to ignite a spark of hope and creativity. How do Drew’s videos work against misinformation,
        then? <br>
        <h3>Finding your North Star</h3>
        Imagine you are watching one of Drew’s videos: say, ”How To Create the Life You Want (And Find Your 
        North Star)” (2019b). The video beings by talking about passion, and its importance for a good life. 
        Eventually, Drew mentions focusing on what matters to you and letting go of what does not. Intrigued,
        you stop the video for a moment to think. This concept reminds you of stoicism, a popular philosophical
        school of thought. Ten minutes later, you have researched a bit into stoicism and found some insights
        that resonate with you. Continuing the video, you reach the part where he compares searching for your
        purpose to finding your way around in a dark room. When he says this, you pause again. You do not agree
        with that notion, and instead see the process more like searching for a needle in a haystack, not 
        knowing whether you have missed it or not. <br>
        The purpose of this dive into one of Drew’s videos is to understand it from the perspective of a viewer.
        These ideas do not exist on their own; Drew inextricably links them to his personal life and opinions.
        Familiar thoughts, phrases, or suggestions he puts forth provide as launching points for an open
        discussion, either with other people or with yourself. His rhetoric and style of teaching is not
        presumptuous, rather, it allows for a difference in opinion. Genuine curiosity and inquiry into
        what we do not understand, which is what Drew attempts to elicit, will lead people to find what
        interests them, what they choose to interact with, and how they do it. As the information found
        on the Internet “[places] the onus on the individual to sort fact from fiction” (Southwell et
        al., 2018), the ability to quickly explore ideas is invaluable. Viewers of Drew explore the
        topics covered without going in-depth unless they wish to pursue something further. It is for
        this reason that Drew fights against misinformation and encourages people to critically assess
        their own beliefs and values regularly.<br>
        Another important consideration is accessibility. Drew makes content for everyone, and this
        highlights how what he speaks to is a possibility for everyone to draw something from. He lowers
        the barrier to understanding jargony language or confusing rhetoric as his videos are easily
        understandable by the young and old alike. Furthermore, he enables a future in which people 
        are free to make decisions for themselves, wherever they are in life. Anyone can do it if they
        are willing to try. I know that in my life, Drew has inspired me to change the way I see things.
        I have begun to shift my mindset from perfection and unrealistic expectations to self-acceptance
        and constant self-refinement, inspired by his ideas and especially the presentation of his videos. <br>
        <h3>Introspection and Self-Reflection</h3>
        Moreover, each of Drew’s videos focuses on using reflection to understand his experiences, which
        inspires others to do the same. Drew points out that “everybody has their own version of [feeling
        behind]” (2018, 0:46), emphasizing the importance of finding your own path. For him, he makes a 
        habit of being overly competitive to the point of robbing joy from himself and overfocusing on 
        improvement. Other people experience this differently, for instance with me, I am always unsure 
        if what I am doing is the best approach, or if this even matters, causing me to focus less on the
        present and worry unnecessarily about the future. Whatever your version is, this introspective 
        process, which is the basis for all his explorations, is distinctly individual and private to
        each person. To keep yourself accountable, it is crucial that you employ techniques like reflection
        and meditation as necessary to figure out what you own areas of improvement are. Having a support 
        system is also integral to this process (Drew, 2019b), however it cannot tell you what you must 
        find within yourself. In addition to self-accountability, reflection enables much customisability
        in your approach. You may wish to take an endeavour more seriously, as he did with meditation 
        (Drew, 2019c), or to completely disconnect from the world as he did in his dopamine detox video 
        (Drew, 2019a). The fact is, each of us is at a different part of our journey, and we all need 
        different things. <br>
        <h3>Different Folks, Different Approach</h3>
        Closely related to the idea of reflection is that each person must find the techniques that work 
        best for them. To give an example, Drew suggests a “solar system” view of language learning, where
        frequently-used words are prioritised, and the learner expands outwards as they go (2021). In the
        comment section, people had varying opinions. While most comments were positive, with a polyglot
        commenter adding that “it’s about core words, connecting words and verbs first,” other people were
        less eager to adapt Drew’s approach. One commenter argued that “personal interest [,] enthusiasm 
        [,] fun [,] and immersion” mattered most, while efficiency was secondary. Therefore, the availability
        of various techniques aids the adaptation of tools for personal growth, as differing viewpoints
        significantly impact these preferences. What works for one person may not work for another, and 
        so trying things out for yourself is key to improving your repertoire of skills. To be clear, Drew
        focuses intensely on cognition, and how we think of ourselves within the world. All the skills 
        he approaches take a distinctly cognitive route, for example meditation to change how the brain 
        thinks (2019c) or language learning as a method of access to other cultures (2021). Drew is a 
        strong advocate for using creativity to spread these ideas, and while they are critical for him
        to share, not everyone will receive them the same way.
        <br> <h3>Do We Have To Take a Cognitive Approach?</h3>
        Overall, the documentation of personal growth concepts as experiential increases its effectiveness
        exponentially, as is the case with Drew’s videos. They actively promote self-awareness and 
        questioning information sources, as well as the importance of finding what works for you and 
        introspection for personal growth. Of note is the overarching focus on each person’s individuality,
        which underscores the themes of universality and generalisability he promotes so tactfully.
        Additionally, his videos are publicly accessible and understandable to a vast audience, further
        cementing the scope of what he can accomplish. Although his current videos are a good starting 
        point, Drew himself continues to emphasise his commitment to personal growth and development of
        his creative integrity. By using a variety of methods to plan and create future videos, he is 
        constantly refining his process, making for a greater impact over time. In the future, Drew will
        develop improved methods for video creation, making an already excellent format a positively 
        brilliant one. The only certainty here is that while Drew can inspire, it is up to the viewers 
        themselves to act. Without that key piece, the videos lose what it is they hope to incite.

        grammar/rewording alternatives. ChatGPT did not write any of the essay’s content. An example
        prompt is, “Extract the core themes of Drew’s arguments across videos.”</p>
