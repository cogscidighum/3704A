        <h3>A Nuanced Approach to Personal Growth</h3>
        <br>Personal growth is the process of continually refining oneself, and it is an ongoing endeavour that never truly ceases. This self-refinement is a recurring idea in the videos of YouTube creator Nathaniel Drew, especially as it concerns our cognitive state of mind. The experiences he shares detailing his experiments offer strong insights into the nature of humans, and how we various techniques or ideas are more conducive to personal growth than others. Some skills he emphasizes include mindfulness, self-acceptance, and finding balance in a hyperactive world. An investigation into five of his popular videos reveals how they all link together, and the overarching themes coalescing into his comprehensive worldview. Drew is no expert, but merely someone interested in sharing innovative ideas in an accessible way; that is, it is as much of a learning experience for him as it is for his viewers. In today’s world, the topics he covers are extremely relevant, as it is difficult to find a moment of peace in our online technology-centric society. Drew’s approach helps to bridge the gap amongst a documentary, self-reflection, and an educational experience. He creates an accessible environment for people to critically reflect on their own lives, and to feel inspired to make a change by exploring these topics for themselves. In this paper, I will argue that content aimed towards personal growth is most effective when presented as a documentation of one’s experiences, rather than as impersonal and information-based.

        prompt is, “Extract the core themes of Drew’s arguments across videos.”</p>
